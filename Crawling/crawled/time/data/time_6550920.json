  "body_text": "2024 is not just an election year. It’s perhaps the election year.Globally, more voters than ever in history will head to the polls as at least 64 countries (plus the European Union)—representing a combined population of about 49% of the people in the world—are meant to hold national elections, the results of which, for many, will prove consequential for years to come.Read More: A Make-or-Break Year for Democracy WorldwideIn Taiwan, for example, who becomes the next president will fundamentally shape Beijing’s approach to the self-governed island it has repeatedly threatened with invasion.Read More: Taiwan’s Presidential Frontrunner Faces Balancing Act With ChinaOf course, simply holding an election does not mean the process will be free or fair.

While Vladimir Putin may be embarking on a sure-win reelection campaign, the March presidential election results, if the true vote breakdown is disclosed, may be viewed as a potential indicator of the strongman’s support—and whether the Russian public continues to back his seemingly endless war. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, it’s unclear if a planned 2024 presidential vote will take place while the besieged nation is currently under martial law, though incumbent leader Volodomyr Zelensky has said he intends to seek another term and his ratings remain high.Read More: Inside Volodymyr Zelensky’s Struggle to Keep Ukraine in the FightElsewhere, key political successions are also already brewing. With a bleak economic outlook casting a shadow over the U.K.’s ruling Conservative Party, which has been in power for nearly 14 years, opinion polls suggest the opposition Labour Party will likely come out on top in Britain’s next general election, which embattled Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to call at some point in 2024.Read More: The Man Who Wants to Fix BritainNot to mention, the elephant in the room; the U.S. presidential race culminating in November has the potential to unleash what the Economist recently described as “the biggest danger to the world” of 2024: former President Donald Trump securing a second term.Below are all the elections scheduled or expected to take place in 2024—compiled from information by the National Democratic Institute, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, and Anchor Change, among other sources, and ordered by population according to projections by the United Nations.For context, each listing also includes the country’s “freedom and fairness score” that ranges from zero (least free and fair) to one (most free and fair) from Our World in Data’s free and fair elections index, which is based on expert assessments by the Swedish think-tank V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy).Population: 1.44BElection(s): Lok Sabha (House of the People)Date(s): expected April -
