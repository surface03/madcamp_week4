        "title_text": "Israeli Family Celebrates Homecoming of Grandmother Taken Hostage by Hamas",
        "body_text": "For 49 days, Adina Moshe was confined underground, unaware of the time and only seeing light for two hours a day. The 72-year-old saw her husband murdered by Hamas on Oct. 7 before she was taken hostage by the militant group and transported to Gaza. Moshe was freed alongside other hostages on Nov. 24 in the first prisoner exchange deal negotiated between Israel and Hamas. Moshe’s nephew, Eyal Nouri, previously spoke to TIME in October for a cover story alongside other families of Israeli hostages. On Sunday, via a video call from his home in Caesarea, Israel, and in subsequent text messages, Nouri told TIME about his aunt’s homecoming.Nouri has yet to speak with his aunt directly, and so relayed reports from her children. Nouri says Moshe told her family that she traversed the muddy terrain of underground tunnels in Gaza for a considerable distance. She recalls finding it hard to breathe due to the high humidity and being held in a room with other hostages, where she lacked access to showers and survived on rice and pita bread. This mirrors accounts by other released hostages and their families, who told the Associated Press and other news outlets that they ate a similar diet, slept on plastic chairs and waited hours to go to the bathroom. When Hamas led Moshe from the tunnel on Nov. 24, she didn’t know if she was being transferred, executed or released, until she saw the Red Cross, Nouri says. Around 9 p.m. local time, Moshe’s family rejoiced in an emotional reunion with her at a hospital outside Tel Aviv. “My whole family is happy, even though Adina has a long journey to come back to real life, she will manage to do so. She has the strength and she has the support of the whole family and the whole country,” Nouri says.  Sharing an update on Moshe's condition, he says she is “very weak physically, but her mentality is very strong.” A video published by Hamas shows Moshe holding the hand of a militant as she steps down from a vehicle during her release, before pushing his hand away—characteristic of her, Nouri says. “She is a brave woman, she knows what she wants.”Moshe was freed, along with 59 other Israeli hostages, in exchange for Israel releasing 180 Palestinian prisoners and allowing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza, in a temporary ceasefire. The initial truce agreement was extended and is currently expected to end on Thursday. Hamas also freed 21 foreign national hostages in a pre-existing separate negotiation. Before the temporary ceasefire, Hamas had already released four hostages—an American mother and daughter on Oct. 20 and two Israeli women on Oct. 23—both for \"humanitarian reasons.\" The current war between the two sides started when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking an estimated 240 hostage. Israel, vowing to eliminate Hamas, responded by bombarding Gaza and periodically cutting off electricity, power and water, resulting in a humanitarian disaster. The Hamas-run health ministry reports at least 15,000 people have been killed.After Qatari and Egyptian mediation, Israel and Hamas agreed to swap detainees. Israel released Palestinian women and boys accused of offenses ranging from throwing stones to attempted murder, some held without trial or charges, out of an estimated thousands detained on security grounds. On Nov. 24, Moshe’s daughter received a message from the Israeli government that Moshe was one of the hostages due to be released, Nouri says. He was on the way to his mother’s home for Shabbat that evening when he saw footage of Moshe in a jeep being released and began shouting with joy. “I didn’t smile for 49 days,” Nouri says, remarking on the length of Moshe’s captivity.On Sunday, Moshe was released from Wolfson Medical Center, where she and other released hostages underwent wellness checks, Nouri says. Her daughter had prepared a room in her house for her mother to stay in after Moshe’s home of 52 years was burned by Hamas.It was in the couple’s safe room in that home that Hamas shot and killed Moshe’s husband, Said David Moshe, says Nouri, who recalls seeing the bullet holes and his uncle’s blood on the floor. His aunt’s phone, found at the scene, showed she was texting for help on how to stop the bleeding.Also in the kibbutz of Nir Oz, near the border with Gaza, Moshe’s son Amos held the door of his safe room, filled with his wife and five children, as militants tried to force their way in, Nouri told TIME in October. Even after the militants set the house on fire, he kept holding the door, his hand burned. After the army rescued the family seven hours later, Amos found out that his father was dead and his mother had been kidnapped. Said Moshe, the brother of Nouri’s mother, was an admired lifelong farmer who grew potatoes and carrots. His uncle belonged to Israel’s left-wing and lived side-by-side with Palestinians, often giving them food, Nouri says. Nouri has continued to rally in Tel Aviv with his family on behalf of other hostages still in Gaza. His main objective and message to the Israeli government is to release all the hostages. “Fighting with Hamas can take a few months, even a year, nobody knows how long. First release the hostages, [then] there is time to fight Hamas,” he says. When asked what concessions the Israeli government should take to make that happen, Nouri says he doesn’t have specific instructions. He believes Hamas should be eliminated either by military or political means: “As long as Hamas is in power, there will be no peace,” he says. When asked about international concern over the killings of civilians in Gaza, Nouri says there is a “double morality when it comes to Israel.” He points out it was Israel who was attacked—with people killed and women reportedly raped—and highlights how the Israeli military has warned people in north Gaza to evacuate and allowed in aid. International aid groups have pressed for more help and a permanent ceasefire, and the World Health Organization said it was impossible to follow earlier Israeli orders to evacuate hospitals. Israel agreed on Oct. 31 to allow trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza each day. On Nov. 23, Israel allowed fuel to enter Gaza, after previously expressing concern that it might be used by Hamas for military purposes.Nouri says after Hamas is eliminated, Israel should reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians. “When you educate the children to hate, they will hate,” he says. “Peace will come after people will be educated.” As for his newly-released aunt, he says “she wants to get her freedom back into her hands” and return to a life of anonymity.",

        "title_text": "K-Pop Isn’t Just Making Fans Outside of Korea. It’s Trying to Make the Genre’s Next Stars",
        "body_text": "For Koreans, becoming a K-pop idol is said to be harder than winning the lottery. For those outside Korea, the path to stardom in the genre may seem even rarer—though soon, industry executives and aspiring stars around the world alike are hoping, those odds may be starting to change.Last week, some 70 students in Singapore got a taste of what it takes to become a K-pop idol, having spent five days attending a K-pop training camp taught by some of the industry’s most renowned dance and vocal coaches who traveled to the Southeast Asian nation from Seoul. The camp was organized by the Singapore Raffles Music College (SRMC), which is planning to open—pending approval from Singapore’s education ministry—the first K-pop high school outside of Korea next year, in collaboration with the School of Performing Arts Seoul (SOPA), a popular arts high school in Seoul that has produced some of K-pop’s biggest names. “We understand that [SOPA] has very strong links in terms of students entering the industry,” Ryan Goh, the executive director of SRMC, tells TIME, adding that he hopes the upcoming program will build the “necessary competency within Southeast Asian talent” to become K-pop stars. The outward-looking expansion—engaging and collaborating with foreign cultures— is “a natural evolution of K-pop,” says Goh, who notes the genre’s increasing internationalism, particularly in the last few years, as the likes of BTS and Blackpink have topped charts and achieved mainstream popularity across the world. “We hope that we’ll have a little part in helping to build that pipeline of talent that will be part of this journey,” he adds.Non-Korean K-pop idols have been around since as early as the 1990s, with groups like Fly to the Sky (a duo with a Korean-American singer) or S.E.S (a girl group with one Japanese member). Today, Blackpink’s Lisa, who is Thai, is the firm favorite of fans across Thailand, a testament to how international K-pop group members can mobilize international audiences. NewJeans and Stray Kids, two relatively new groups fast on the rise, each have two Australian members.“Strategically it makes so much sense to get people who can communicate with fans from different areas,” CedarBough Saeji, assistant professor of Korean and East Asian studies at Pusan National University, tells TIME.The new school may seem like an unprecedented gateway opening for young Southeast Asians to join the ranks of professional K-pop artists, but success—and happiness—is certainly not guaranteed.While high schools that cater specifically to K-pop training are a relatively new, but growing, phenomenon, the system of “idol training” that the K-pop industry is looking to export is already firmly established in Korea, where every year thousands of adolescents are filtered through a notoriously brutal regimen, during which they are made to adhere to punishing schedules and maintain strict diets, while being deprived of a social life and much of their personal freedom. And even among those who complete their traineeship, only a fraction are selected by record labels to debut as K-pop idols. For every group or solo act that breaks through, there are thousands of other dashed “Hallyu-wood” dreams—trainees who land in crippling debt or who have alleged coercion or exploitation by their management. “I love that young people have dreams, and the K-pop industry is enormously attractive, but it's also a really, really tough industry,” says Saeji. “I see too many young people who get into the industry, perhaps too young, and it chews them up. It is not an easy life. And I think that when you're 16 years old, you don't understand how hard it can be.”“I worry a little bit that these kinds of schools are making up profit off the dreams of young people,” Saeji adds. “They’re setting some young people up for a difficult future, perhaps for disappointment.”Still, for many students and their parents, the rigorous curriculum and sizeable pricetag of K-pop training aren’t enough to deter the pursuit of stardom.“These past five days have been really tough,” says Chu Xiyi, a 17-year-old camp attendee and incoming vocal training student at SRMC. “But if this would let me have a better future, then I think this is all very worth it.”Lai Hooi Chin, who enrolled her 12-year-old daughter in the camp, which cost more than $2,000, tells TIME they’ve also signed up for another K-pop boot camp held in Seoul next month for around the same price. Her daughter, Ong Lixuan, tells TIME, after participating in a showcase on the camp’s final night, that the grueling five days of training only strengthened her resolve. “I told myself before that even if it’s hard, I’m not gonna give up,” she says. “Because that’s my dream. That’s what I’ve been chasing for.”K-pop teachers don’t shy away from the hard reality. “Being an idol is not just a dream,” one SOPA instructor solemnly told a room full of enthusiastic teen and tween attendees on the last day of the camp. “It's a job, just like any job.”SRMC’s Goh says that the recent camp was aimed at giving students a “complete experience” of the K-pop industry. The school, he adds, which is expecting to commence with 75 students in the second half of 2024, will make sure to incorporate sufficient breadth in its curriculum to prepare students “if they are unable to become a star.”",

        "title_text": "It’s Time to Scrap the Abraham Accords",
        "body_text": "When the United Arab Emirates first signed the Abraham Accords in 2020—normalizing relations with Israel—its rulers hailed the agreement as a means to encourage and cajole Israel to take positive steps toward ending its occupation and annexation of Palestinian territory. Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco followed suit.But the real premise of the Accords was proving that the Palestinian issue was no longer an obstacle for Israel’s relationships in the region, as Arab states dropped their demand for a Palestinian state as a condition to normalizing ties with Israel. The pact promised regional security despite allowing Israel to bypass the rights of 6 million Palestinians living under daily brutality, military occupation, and apartheid rule to establish alliances with authoritarian regional regimes. As many of us predicted at the time—myself included—that was always bound to fail. The shocking Hamas attack on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people in Israel, has now made that clear to all.Rather than curbing Israeli abuses, the Accords emboldened successive Israeli governments to further ignore Palestinian rights. In the first year after the Accords, settler violence dramatically increased in the West Bank. Following the election of Israel’s most right-wing government in history in 2022, cabinet ministers openly called for the annexation of the West Bank and announced massive settlement expansions. In the year leading up to Oct. 7, Israeli forces had already killed almost 200 Palestinians in the West Bank. Israel has rained destruction on Gaza since the Hamas attack, killing at least 15,500 people, 70% of them women and children, while floating plans echoed by Israel’s Intelligence Minister to forcibly displace Gazans to Egypt and pushing the Egyptian government to offer them permanent housing and residence permits in the Sinai. Dozens of scholars have described Israel’s campaign as a genocide.Read More: Listening to the Youth Voices of GazaLet’s be clear: Continued Arab adherence to the Accords signals continued support for Israel, rewarding it with the military, economic, and trade development that were always the primary goal. That is why we at the Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a rights group set up by Jamal Khashoggi, have publicly called on the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan to immediately withdraw from the Accords and, alongside peace treaty signatories Egypt and Jordan, end all military coordination with Israel.Bahrain has already inched in that direction, with its parliament proclaiming it was ending all economic ties to Israel after sending the Israeli ambassador home. Arab states hosting U.S. military bases, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Qatar, also should publicly declare that they will not permit the U.S. to use these bases to supply weapons to or provide protection for Israeli forces during its ongoing war in Gaza, or risk being seen as complicit.Both the Trump and Biden administrations hailed the Accords as an important effort to expand peace in the Middle East, going so far as to coax signatory Arab states with a host of goodies to persuade them to establish a formal relationship with Israel. These include selling 50 long-desired F-35 fighter jets to the tiny UAE; recognizing Morocco’s illegal annexation of Western Sahara, making the U.S. the first country in the world to do so; and removing Sudan from the list of designated terrorist states and loaning it $1.5 billion. The Accords were focused on each state’s own strategic interests, particularly in building a regional alliance less reliant on Washington. For Israel, the Accords have dramatically expanded not only Israeli trade and diplomatic relations with the signatory Arab states—most significantly the wealthy petro-dollar states the UAE and Bahrain—but also military and intelligence coordination. In 2021, the U.S. moved Israel from its European Command to its U.S. Central Command covering the Middle East, facilitating and \"deepening\" more direct military and operational cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors that includes intelligence sharing and a regional air defense network called the Middle East Air Defense Alliance. Israeli F-35 squadrons and American F-35s flying from Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE have conducted several joint aerial drills, dubbed Enduring Lightning. In 2021, the UAE, Bahrain, Israel, and the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command conducted maritime security operations exercises in the Red Sea, while Israeli weapons manufacturers have also significantly expanded their business with Arab states. In 2022, Israel exported $3 billion in defense products to the UAE and Bahrain alone.All this needs to end. The Israel-Hamas truce late last month brought a much-needed reprieve to Gaza’s 2 million people who have been subject to intense bombardment and mass displacement. The temporary ceasefire came to a halt on Friday with the return of deadly Israeli airstrikes. But if Israel is faced with the prospect of losing its regional security architecture, perhaps it will listen to growing calls on what is needed most—a permanent ceasefire. Correction, Jan. 16, 2024The original version of this story misstated the amount that Israel exported to the UAE and Bahrain in 2022. It is $3 billion, not $12.6 billion.",

        "title_text": "South Korean Farmers Threaten to Release 2 Million Dogs in Protest of Dog Meat Ban",
        "body_text": "In the face of a proposed dog meat ban in South Korea, about 200 dog farmers held a protest near the presidential office in Seoul on Thursday. The Korea Dog Meat Farmers’ Association—which has long opposed moves to crack down on the industry—also said that it was mulling the release of 2 million dogs near government landmarks in Seoul as well as the homes of lawmakers. “If you ask how big the opposition from farmers is, we’re talking about releasing 2 million dogs we’re raising,” Joo Young-bong, the head of the association said during a radio show last week. He then listed targeted sites including the presidential office, the agriculture minister’s home and offices of lawmakers who have introduced the bills.Joo, who led the rally on Thursday, was among three protestors who were arrested by the police after a scuffle between the two sides, Reuters reported. Authorities also set up barricades to stop the demonstrators from moving closer to the presidential office. Protesters claimed that they had brought along 100 dogs in vehicles, but were stopped by police from letting the dogs out.According to a bill which aims to end South Korea’s dog meat trade by 2027, announced by the ruling People Power Party on Nov. 17, businesses—such as dog farms, butchers, retailers, and restaurants—will have to submit to local authorities their plans to phase out dog meat. They would also be given a three-year grace period, as well as financial aid from the government, to transition out of the trade. The People Power Party also suggested a maximum five-year jail sentence or a fine of 50 million won ($38,000) for offenders of the ban. The bill is the result of rare bipartisan support, after 44 lawmakers from both the ruling party and the opposition Democratic Party of Korea formed a group last month to discuss the issue. But among the most prominent advocates for the ban is first lady Kim Keon-hee, with whom South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol shares five cats and six dogs. (Yoon had previously drawn criticism, even from fellow party members, for proposing that the anti-dog meat bill be named after his wife.)Last week, Kim also mentioned the legislative development to Queen Camilla during the couple’s state visit to London, In response, Queen Camilla said they welcomed Kim’s efforts,  a presidential spokesperson later told reporters. Governmental initiatives mulling dog meat bans in South Korea have stalled in the past because of heated protests from those in the industry.Authorities say there are over 1,000 breeding farms and 34 slaughterhouses in South Korea, as well as some 1,600 restaurants that serve dog meat. Industry representatives say the numbers are far bigger, with an estimated 3,500 farms and 3,000 restaurants that face risks of shutting down should a ban be implemented.Dog meat farmers are again vehemently opposing the recent bill, arguing that their livelihoods are at stake, and that the ban would erase the culture of dog meat consumption. Besides the recent threat to release dogs in Seoul, supporters of the dog meat trade have resorted to similar moves in the past, such as staging a dog meat tasting event in front of the National Assembly in 2019, while animal rights activists called for a ban on the trade.The centuries-old practice of eating dog meat, which is traditionally known to combat summer heat, is typically only eaten by older people today—the cuisine has come under increasing controversy, amid animal cruelty concerns and the rising popularity of dogs as household pets.According to a 2023 Nielsen poll commissioned by Humane Society International, an animal advocacy group, 86% of South Koreans have little intention of consuming dog meat, and 57% support a ban on dog meat consumption. A Gallup Korea poll last year showed that 64% of respondents opposed dog meat consumption. Joo, the chairman of the dog meat farmers’ association, said that while he agreed with public health and cruelty concerns surrounding breeding and slaughter facilities, he said that the solution was for the dogs to be recognized as livestock and farmers made to abide by food safety standards. A previous attempt by authorities to categorize dogs as livestock in 2008 was met with opposition from animal rights activists, who claimed that the move would legitimize the dog meat trade, which is neither legal nor explicitly prohibited. The practice is also a sore spot for the country’s growing prominence on the international stage, some argue. “Foreigners think South Korea is a cultural powerhouse. But the more K-culture increases its international standing, the bigger shock foreigners experience over our dog meat consumption,” said Han Jeoung-ae, an opposition lawmaker who supports a ban on dog meat, in June. Last year, an exchange program sending South Korean high school students to a town in New Jersey was axed after activists complained about the dog meat trade in the students’ hometown of Gangwha. The recently proposed ban was welcomed by animal rights groups which have campaigned for years for an end to the country’s dog meat trade. HSI, which has participated in rescue operations on South Korea’s dog farms, said in a statement that the proposed ban was a “dream come true.”Lola Webber, the director of HSI’s End Dog Meat campaign, tells TIME that the group has been working with dog meat farmers in South Korea for almost a decade, encouraging them to switch to more sustainable livelihoods. “Most of these farmers have experienced societal, family and financial pressure to get out of farming dogs,” she says. “With so few people wanting to eat dog meat in the country, it’s gotten harder to make a living and these farmers know the writing is on the wall for this cruel industry.”“So the threats and protests that we always hear from the small but vocal dog farmer associations whenever a ban is suggested, is not really in the farmers’ best interests nor representative of farmers as a whole.”",

        "title_text": "Why Europe Must Not Let AI Firms Put Profits Before People ",
        "body_text": "The soap opera-like ousting and swift return of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman produced plenty of fodder for ironic quips online but it also exposed some serious fault lines. One such critique I enjoyed was: “How are we supposed to solve the AI alignment problem if aligning just a few board members presents an insurmountable challenge?”As the company behind ChatGPT, OpenAI may be one of the more recognizable names, but artificial intelligence is more than one company. It's a technology of immense consequence, yet it remains almost entirely unregulated. The E.U. has a chance to meaningfully tackle that challenge—but not if it bends the knee to Big Tech’s ongoing onslaught. Inspirational Members of the European Parliament have so far been standing firm in the face of incredible pressure, in an effort to save this landmark legislation. On the weekend, E.U. Commissioner Thierry Breton spoke out against what he claims are self-serving lobbying efforts by France’s Mistral AI and other AI companies that do not serve public interest. These lawmakers need and deserve our support at this crucial moment. Europe is poised to lead in a world that is waking up to the need to regulate AI. From the U.S. Executive Order to the recent AI Safety Summit hosted by the U.K. at Bletchley Park, countries everywhere are recognising that if we are going to share the benefits of this incredible technology, we must mitigate its risks. The E.U. AI Act will be the first comprehensive legal framework aimed at doing precisely this, but a handful of technology firms are holding the political process hostage, threatening to sink the ship unless their systems are exempt from regulation. To capitulate will damage European innovation, put profits before public safety, and represent an affront to democracy. Our lawmakers must not bend the knee. On Nov. 10 negotiations broke down after France and Germany pushed back against proposed regulation of “foundation models.” Together with Italy, they subsequently released a nonpaper that articulated these demands, asking that companies building foundation models only be subject to voluntary commitments. Foundation models are general-purpose machine learning systems, such as Open AI’s GPT-4 (which underpins ChatGPT), that can be subsequently applied to a large range of downstream applications and functions. Regulating these foundation models will force AI corporations to make sure they are safe before deployment, rather than waiting to act until after dangerous systems are released, which comes with clear danger of public harm. Given growing concern on the potential risks presented by these advanced systems, including mass misinformation, enabled bioterrorism, hacking of critical infrastructure, large-scale cyber attacks and more, this is a sensible provision to include. Read More: E.U.’s AI Regulation Could Be Softened After Pushback From Biggest MembersWe have seen first-hand the need for codified legal protections, rather than relying on corporate self-regulation. For example, the psychological harm wrought by social media on young women and girls has become increasingly apparent. The companies that ran the platforms and channels that hosted harmful content were aware of this damage for years yet failed to act. Voluntary commitments are neither sufficient nor reliable. We need prevention, rather than cure, if we want to stop people getting hurt. We need enforceable safety standards and risk mitigation for powerful AI from the start. So why the objection? Holdouts claim that it will hinder innovation for businesses who want to adapt and use AI, but this simply isn’t true. Regulating foundation models is essential for innovation as it will protect downstream smaller European users from the requirements of compliance, and from liability if things go wrong. There are only a handful of very well-resourced companies that are developing the most impactful foundation models, but there are thousands of small companies in the E.U. that have already adopted them for concrete business applications, and many more who plan to do so. We need balanced obligations across the value chain—the broadest shoulders should bear the biggest load.This is reflected in the makeup of the opposing sides. The European DIGITAL SME Alliance, comprising 45,000 business members, wants to regulate foundation models. Two European AI corporations (France’s Mistral AI and Germany’s Aleph Alpha), along with a handful of giant U.S. firms do not. Their argument is also not borne out by real-world experience. My own country Estonia is bound by the exact same E.U. rules and regulations as Germany, yet has a vibrant and thriving startup ecosystem. If those who oppose regulation of foundation models, like Mistral’s Cedric O, are looking to point the finger, they must look elsewhere. In truth, while those opposing regulation claim to be protecting the E.U.’s innovation ecosystem, such a step-down would more likely transfer financial and legal burdens away from large corporations and onto startups, which have neither the ability nor the resources to change the underlying models. France and Germany also claim that regulating foundation models will stifle Europe’s ability to compete in AI on the global stage. This doesn’t hold up. The tiered approach proposed, which is already a compromise between the Parliament and the Council of the E.U., allows for targeting so that competitors to major AI companies can emerge without onerous restrictions. European lawmakers should close their ears to fearmongering pushed by Big Tech and its newest allies, and remember the Act’s purpose: To achieve a fair and balanced framework that safeguards innovation while preventing harm. It must not be a legislative device for anointing a few Silicon Valley-backed AI leaders with sectoral supremacy and zero requirements, while preventing thousands of European businesses from maximizing the technology’s potential. The Parliament supports regulating foundation models, as do many in the Commission and the Council. The business community endorses it, as do the thousands of AI experts who have profound concerns about the dangers of these increasingly powerful systems if left unchecked. A handful of tech firms should not be allowed to hold our political process to ransom, threatening to detonate this landmark legislation and throw away three years of work. They must not be allowed to put their profits before our safety, and to put market capture before European innovation. ",

        "title_text": "Hamas and Israel Exchange More Hostages for Prisoners on Fifth day of Temporary Cease-Fire",
        "body_text": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Hamas released 12 hostages and Israel released 30 Palestinian prisoners on Tuesday, the fifth day of a fragile cease-fire that has enabled humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza and that mediators hope to extend even as Israel pledges to resume the war.Israel said 10 of its citizens and two Thai nationals freed by Hamas returned to Israel. Soon after, Israel released the Palestinian prisoners. The truce is due to end after one more exchange Wednesday night.CIA director William Burns and David Barnea, who heads Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, were in Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, to discuss extending the cease-fire and releasing more hostages, a diplomat said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. A U.S. official confirmed Burns was in Qatar, speaking anonymously because the director’s travel plans are not publicized for security reasons.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit the region this week, also with an eye to extending the truce.Israel has vowed to resume the war with “full force” to destroy Hamas once it’s clear that no more hostages will be freed under the deal.The Biden administration has told Israel it must avoid “significant further displacement” and mass casualties among Palestinian civilians if it resumes the offensive, and that it must operate with more precision in southern Gaza than it has in the north, according to U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House.Hamas and other militants are still holding about 160 hostages out of the 240 seized in their Oct. 7 assault into southern Israel that ignited the war. Israel has said it is willing to extend the cease-fire by one day for every 10 additional hostages that Hamas releases, according to the deal brokered by the Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. But Hamas is expected to make much higher demands for the release of captive soldiers.Israel has vowed to end Hamas’ 16-year rule in Gaza and crush its military capabilities. That would almost certainly require expanding the ground offensive from northern Gaza to the south, where most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million is now crowded. It’s unclear where they would go if Israel expands its ground operation, as Egypt has refused to accept refugees and Israel has sealed its border.The latest group of Israeli hostages freed from Gaza — nine women and a 17-year-old — was flown to hospitals in Israel, the Israeli military said.Tuesday's hostage release brought to 60 the number of Israelis freed under the terms of the truce between Israel and Hamas. An additional 21 hostages — 19 Thais, one Filipino and one Russian-Israeli — have been released in separate negotiations since the truce began.Earlier in the war, Hamas released four Israeli hostages, and the Israeli army rescued one during its offensive in Gaza. Two other hostages were found dead in Gaza.The latest swap brought to 180 the number of Palestinian women and teenagers freed from Israeli prisons. Most have been teenagers accused of throwing stones and firebombs during confrontations with Israeli forces. Several released women were convicted by Israeli military courts of attempting to carry out deadly attacks. The prisoners are widely seen by Palestinians as heroes resisting occupation.The freed hostages have mostly stayed out of the public eye, but details of their captivity have started to emerge.In one of the first interviews with a freed hostage, 78-year-old Ruti Munder told Israel’s Channel 13 television that she was initially fed well in captivity but that conditions worsened as shortages took hold. She said she was kept in a “suffocating” room and slept on plastic chairs with a sheet for nearly 50 days.Israel imposed a siege on Gaza at the start of the war and only allowed a trickle of food, water, medicine and fuel to enter prior to the cease-fire, leading to widespread shortages and a territory-wide power blackout.Tuesday saw the first major exchange of fire between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters in northern Gaza since the cease-fire began Friday. Each side blamed the other for the outbreak, but no further violence followed and the swap went ahead. Still, it underscored the fragility of the truce, with the warring sides holding their positions in close proximity to each other.The cease-fire has allowed residents who remained in Gaza City and other parts of the north to venture out to survey the destruction and try to locate and bury relatives.In northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, which Israel bombarded heavily for weeks and which troops surrounded in heavy fighting with militants, “you come across whole city blocks that have been demolished, just a pancake of concrete layered as buildings have collapsed,” said Thomas White, the Gaza director for the U.N. agency caring for Palestinian refugees.The agency delivered six trucks of aid to the camp, including supplies for a medical center. Footage of White’s visit showed streets lined with destroyed buildings, cars, and piles of rubble.A U.N.-led aid consortium estimates that, across Gaza, over 234,000 homes have been damaged and 46,000 completely destroyed, amounting to around 60% of the territory’s housing stock. In the north, the destruction “severely compromises the ability to meet basic requirements to sustain life,” it said.More than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, roughly two-thirds of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. More than 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed in the initial attack.At least 77 soldiers have been killed in Israel’s ground offensive. Israel says it has killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence.Authorities were able to reopen the dialysis department at Gaza City’s Shifa hospital after medical teams brought a small generator. Around 20 patients there had gone two or three weeks without dialysis, Dr. Mutasim Salah told Al-Jazeera TV from the hospital.Two weeks ago, Israeli forces seized the hospital, which Israel had contended was used as a major base by Hamas, an accusation that the group and hospital staff deny.Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive have displaced more than 1.8 million people, nearly 80% of Gaza’s population, with most having sought refuge in the south, according to the U.N. Hundreds of thousands of people have packed into U.N.-run schools and other facilities, with many forced to sleep on the streets outside because of overcrowding.Though, rain and cold winds sweeping across Gaza have made conditions even more miserable.On Tuesday, Hanan Tayeh returned to her destroyed home in the central town of Johor al-Deek, scouring for any belongings in the wreckage.“I came to get anything for my daughters. Winter has come, and I have nothing for them to wear,” she said. “It is cold, we are homeless.”The cease-fire has allowed increased aid of 160 to 200 trucks a day into Gaza, bringing desperately needed food, water and medicine, as well as fuel for homes, hospitals and water treatment plants. Still, it is less than half what Gaza was importing before the fighting, even as humanitarian needs have soared.Juliette Toma, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said people come to shelters asking for heavy clothes, mattresses and blankets, and that some are sleeping in damaged vehicles.“The needs are overwhelming,” she told The Associated Press. “They lost everything, and they need everything.”",

        "title_text": "What to Know About Australia’s Disposable Vape Ban",
        "body_text": "Australia will ban the importation of disposable vapes starting Jan. 1, the government announced on Tuesday, citing concerns of young people becoming addicted to nicotine. Plans for an import ban on nonprescription vaping products were first announced in May, as part of a broader set of legislation aimed at cracking down on the vape industry and stamping out recreational vaping, which authorities have identified as a brewing public health crisis.Here’s what you need to know about Australia’s imminent ban on disposable vapes, along with other restrictions to come.While vapes were initially marketed as a way to help long-term smokers quit, they have ended up “being used to recruit a new generation to nicotine addiction,” Australian health minister Mark Butler said at a press conference on Tuesday.Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia, killing about 20,000 people in the country every year, according to authorities. Australia has strict tobacco laws, and has seen smoking prevalence decline steadily in the last few decades thanks to increased tobacco taxes and anti-smoking legislation.But authorities are concerned that vaping is a new gateway to smoking, saying that there’s “strong and consistent evidence” that youths who vape are three times more likely to start smoking tobacco. Butler added that about one in four Australians aged 18 to 24 vape, and that the products have been “deliberately and cynically marketed” to young people in the country.“You'll see in the vape stores, you'll see in convenience stores, vapes that have pink unicorns on them that are flavored in a way to deliberately attract young people,” he said. “You will see them disguised deliberately as highlighter pens or USB sticks so that students can put them in their pencil case and not have them detected by teachers or their parents.”“Like all other illegal drugs, there will no doubt be some vapes that get into the country,” Butler said in a separate press statement, “but they will no longer be easy for school children, our most vulnerable and impressionable members of society, to get their hands on them.”A host of other policies are expected to take effect on March 1, 2024, such as an import ban on all other vapes regardless of their nicotine content, as well as a mandatory license for importers of therapeutic vapes. Regulations for therapeutic vapes will also be beefed up next year, such as restrictions on flavors, reduction in nicotine concentrations, and requirements for plain product packaging. While these changes are expected to be implemented by March 1 businesses will be given specific “transition periods” to adjust to the new requirements, according to Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration Amendments to the country’s therapeutic goods law are also expected to be introduced in autumn 2024, such as a ban on domestic manufacture, supply, and advertising of vapes.Besides tightened regulations on the vaping industry, authorities have also committed to a budget of A$511.1 million ($340 million) over the next four years to tackle the country’s smoking and vaping problem, such as enhancing cessation support services, national public health campaigns to discourage people—especially youths—from smoking and vaping, as well as clinical guidance for healthcare workers. The government also said that starting Jan. 1, doctors and nurses will be allowed to prescribe therapeutic vapes where clinically appropriate.The incoming regulations, which prohibit retail stores from sell vapes, are not meant to target the users of vape products, according to authorities. When asked about those caught using illegal vapes, Butler said on a local radio show that the bans will “focus on vendors, not on people, not on customers, certainly not on kids.”“I want to be really clear that we’re going after the vendors,” he said. “Those are the ones, I think, as well as the importers, who have created this problem, not the customers themselves, certainly not young people.” “All of us basically have been duped, not just here in Australia, across the world, by an industry who pretended this was going to be a therapeutic product to help long-term smokers kick the habit and instead have created a huge health challenge for our younger citizens.”The surging popularity of vapes, especially among teens and children, have created a regulatory headache for governments around the world. Since August, neighboring New Zealand has implemented similar curbs on disposable vapes to target youth vapingRead More: New Zealand Scraps the World’s First Generational Smoking Ban. Here’s What to KnowIn the U.S., different states have implemented varying restrictions on vapes, including statewide bans. The country has also banned the import of popular vape products like Juul or Elf Bar—though manufacturers have been able to circumvent the restrictions by rebranding themselves. France is also planning a ban on disposable vapes, similarly citing their influence on young people, as part of a nationwide anti-smoking campaign.Countries across Asia have in recent years tightened their vape laws, ranging from restrictions on flavors to thorough bans on sale and consumption of the products. But in April, Malaysia bucked the trend by ending a longtime ban on nicotine liquids and gel used in vapes, allowing them to be sold openly and taxed, with authorities arguing that a blanket ban would not be as effective in curbing vaping as regulation.",

        "body_text": "NEW DELHI — India has set up a high-level inquiry after U.S. authorities raised concerns with New Delhi that its government may have had knowledge of a plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader on American soil, an Indian official said on Wednesday.The U.S. side shared some information and India \"takes such inputs seriously since they impinge on our national security interests as well, and relevant departments were already examining the issue,” a statement by External Affairs Ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said.The U.S. government said it had raised the issue with New Delhi but declined to comment on when or how U.S. officials became aware of the plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is considered a terrorist by the Indian government, as well as how the alleged assassination attempt was derailed.In September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were credible allegations that the Indian government may have had links to the assassination in that country of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India rejected the accusation as absurd, but Canada expelled a top Indian diplomat and India responded with the same measure.Pannun has been a leading organizer of the so-called Khalistan referendum, inviting Sikhs worldwide to vote on whether India's Punjab state should become an independent nation based on religion. Organizers of the nonbinding referendum hope to present the results to the U.N. General Assembly in about two years.Pannun, general counsel with Sikhs for Justice, has been listed as a terrorist by the Indian government. The organization was banned by India in 2019.Bagchi said that the Indian government formed a high-level inquiry committee on Nov. 18 to look into all the aspects of the matter.",

        "title_text": "U.S. Air Force Osprey Crashes off Southern Japan During Training, at Least 1 Onboard Dead",
        "body_text": "TOKYO — A U.S. Air Force Osprey based in Japan crashed during a training mission Wednesday off of the country's southern coast, killing at least one of the eight crew members, the Japanese coast guard said.The cause of the crash and the status of the seven others on board were not immediately known, Japanese coast guard spokesperson Kazuo Ogawa said.The Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter, but during flight it can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster like an airplane.Ospreys have had a number of accidents in the past, including in Japan, where they are deployed at U.S. and Japanese military bases. In Okinawa, where about half of the 50,000 American troops are based, Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters Wednesday that he would ask the U.S. military to suspend all Osprey flights in Japan.Ogawa said the coast guard received an emergency call Wednesday afternoon from a fishing boat near the crash site off Yakushima, an island south of Kagoshima on the southern main island of Kyushu.Coast guard aircraft and patrol boats found one male crew member, who was later pronounced dead by a doctor at a nearby port, Ogawa said. They also found gray debris believed to be from the aircraft and an empty inflatable life raft in an area about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) off the eastern coast of Yakushima, he said.The coast guard said it planned to continue searching through the night.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the Osprey disappeared from radar a few minutes before the coast guard received the emergency call. The aircraft requested an emergency landing at the Yakushima airport about five minutes before it was lost from radar, NHK public television and other news outlets reported.NHK quoted a Yakushima resident as saying he saw the aircraft turned upside down, with fire coming from one of its engines, and then an explosion before it fell to the sea.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he planned to seek a further explanation from the U.S. military, but he declined to say whether he would seek a temporary suspension of Osprey operations in Japan.U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command said in a statement that the CV-22B Osprey was from Yokota Air Base and assigned to the 353rd Special Operations Wing.Ogawa said the aircraft had departed from the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi prefecture and crashed on its way to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa.Japanese Vice Defense Minister Hiroyuki Miyazawa said it had attempted an emergency sea landing and quoted the U.S. military as saying its pilot “did everything possible until the last minute.\"Yokota Air Base is home to U.S. Forces Japan and the Fifth Air Force. Six CV-22 Ospreys have been deployed at Yokota, including the one that crashed.While the U.S. Marine Corps flies most of the Ospreys based in Japan, the Air Force also has some deployed there.Last year, Air Force Special Operations Command ordered a temporary stand down of its Osprey fleet following back-to-back safety incidents where the Osprey clutch slipped, causing an uneven distribution of power to Osprey's rotors.The Marine Corps and Navy have reported similar clutch slips, and each service has worked to address the issue in their aircraft, however clutch failure was also cited in a 2022 fatal U.S. Marine Corps Osprey crash that killed five.According to the investigation of that crash, “dual hard clutch engagement” led to engine failure.Separately, a U.S. Marine Corps Osprey with 23 Marines aboard crashed on a northern Australian island in August, killing three Marines and critically injuring at least five others who were onboard during a multinational training exercise.",

        "title_text": "Divers Recover Seventh of Eight Crew Members Killed in U.S. Osprey Aircraft Crash Off Japan’s Coast",
        "body_text": "Of the eight U.S. airmen aboard the Osprey aircraft that crashed off Japan’s coast, all of whom have been identified, the remains of seven have been recovered so far, while one remains unaccounted for. Navy divers recovered the remains of a seventh crew member on Dec. 10, the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command said in a statement shared via social media.\"During a combined U.S.-Japanese search and rescue in the vicinity of Yakushima, Japan on Dec. 10, 2023, divers from the U.S. Navy located and divers from the 320th Special Tactics Squadron recovered the remains of one of two remaining Airmen,\" the statement read.“Currently there is a combined effort in locating and recovering the remains of our eighth Airman. The main priority is bringing our Airmen home and taking care of their family members.” The U.S. Air Force previously said operations to find the final missing airmen, as well as aircraft debris, would continue, though the operations had transitioned from “search and rescue” to “search and recovery.”This news comes after the  U.S. military made the move to suspend flying of all of its Osprey V-22 aircrafts.The Air Force Special Operations Command and the Naval Air Systems Command announced the decision to ground the aircraft late Tuesday, as a preliminary investigation found that a “potential materiel failure” caused the crash.Air Force Special Operations Command commander Lt. Gen. Tony D. Bauernfeind directed the standdown of its Ospreys, saying that temporarily grounding them “will provide time and space for a thorough investigation to determine causal factors and recommendations to ensure the Air Force CV-22 fleet returns to flight operations.”The Naval Air Systems Command followed by also grounding its V-22 Osprey variants, as part of “additional risk mitigation controls to ensure the safety of our service members.” According to the Associated Press, the command is responsible for the Marine Corps and Navy variants of the aircraft.Japan’s Self-Defense Forces already grounded the Ospreys they operate until the circumstances around the crash are clarified, according to a defense ministry official.Here’s what to know about the accident.On Wednesday, officials received a call at around 2:47 p.m. local time notifying them of an accident, per NBC News. A team was immediately sent to the scene. Less than two hours later, a rescue team found gray-colored debris and an overturned life raft with no people on board.Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said that the Osprey aircraft, which was in use for a training mission, had disappeared from radar around noon, just before the coast guard was informed of the accident. The aircraft was looking to conduct an emergency landing at Yakushima airport before they lost connection to the base, according to Japanese media outlet NHK.An eyewitness told NHK they saw a fire break out on the left wing after the aircraft turned over, before the Osprey fell into the sea.A coast guard spokesperson, Kazuo Ogawa, was initially quoted as saying the aircraft contained eight people, but later said the number had been revised to six. However, a U.S. defense official has since clarified that eight people were, in fact, onboard.Search and rescue teams located five deceased crew members near the main fuselage of the aircraft wreckage on Monday. The aircraft was originally carrying eight people when the CV-22 Osprey from the U.S. Air Force Yokota Air Base crashed near the island of Kyush on Nov. 29.The Air Force identified three of the airmen who died in the crash: U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Jacob “Jake” M. Galliher, 24; Sgt. Zachary E. Lavoy, 33; and Maj. Luke A. Unrath, 34.The status of the five other airmen, one of whose bodies remains unrecovered, was changed from DUSTWUN (duty status-whereabouts unknown) to deceased, the Air Force said on Tuesday. The other victims include Maj. Jeffrey T. Hoernemann, 32; Maj. Eric V. Spendlove, 36; Capt. Terrell K. Brayman, 32, Tech. Staff Sgt. Jake M. Turnage, 25; and Senior Airman Brian K. Johnson, 32.Navy divers recovered a seventh body on Dec. 10. The identity of the airman has been determined, but the information will not be released until next of kin have been notified, Air Force Special Command Operations said in an update. Responding to the crash, President Joe Biden said that he and First Lady Jill were “heartbroken” over the loss of eight American service members. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also offered his condolences in a letter to Biden, saying he was “deeply saddened” over the crash.An Osprey is a military aircraft that is mostly used to transport “troops, equipment, and supplies from assault ships and land bases,” according to the U.S. Marine Corps.The aircraft is dual-piloted and has a vertical take off and landing, which means that the propellers on the aircraft allow it to fly like a helicopter, as well as an airplane. Its versatility makes it more appealing to the military because the CV-22 can be used in missions that would typically require two types of aircraft, the U.S. Air Force says. The V-22 Osprey, one of many variants of this aircraft, is due to replace older helicopters and other fleets in the Corps.But the aircraft has a complex history. In 2001, the Corps fired a commander of its V-22 Osprey squadron after he ordered members of his unit to lie on aircraft maintenance records. The aircraft was known to need intensive maintenance and had caused the death of at least 19 Marines, per a 2001 Washington Post report.There have also been a few accidents involving the aircraft in recent years. A previous incident killed three servicemen in Australia during a training exercise being performed in August 2023. Five U.S. marines also died in San Diego in August 2022 after an “aviation mishap” while flying an Osprey during a training mission In August 2022, an Air Force commander said they would ground all 52 of its CV-22 Ospreys due to safety incidents involving the aircraft's clutch. And in February, the Marine Corps announced that it would restrict flight on a subset of V-22s until they could.In December 2016, an Osprey aircraft crashed near the Okinawa coast. That crash triggered protests in Okinawa due to safety concerns and strong anti-U.S. military sentiment, the AP reported.",

        "title_text": "Finland Temporarily Closes Last Border Crossing With Russia",
        "body_text": "Finland shut down its only remaining checkpoint on the border with Russia at midnight Wednesday after an influx of 900 asylum seekers crossed the border from Russia into Finland this month.It is not expected to reopen for at least another two weeks. The Prime Minister of Finland, Petteri Orpo, said that he believes some of the asylum seekers were purposely sent by the Russian government. “Russia is enabling the instrumentalisation of people and guiding them to the Finnish border in harsh winter conditions. Finland is determined to put an end to this phenomenon,” Prime Minister Orpo said in a government press release on Tuesday.Russia has not immediately responded to Finland’s decision, but has denied encouraging asylum seekers to enter Finland. The Finnish government says that most of the asylum seekers are coming from Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan without proper documentation.“We have proof showing that, unlike before, not only Russian border authorities are letting people without proper documentation to the Finnish border, but they are also actively helping them to the border zone,” Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told the Associated Press last week.Last week, Finland closed seven of the eight checkpoints along the 830-mile Russia-Finland border. The Raja-Jooseppi crossing in the North was the only checkpoint still open until it was shut down Wednesday. Relations between Russia and Finland have become strained since the start of the war with Ukraine. Finland declared its intent to join NATO in May 2022 and became an official member in April 2023. This prompted an outcry from the Russian government, which sees each new NATO member on its border as a threat to its security. \"Helsinki's policy of military non-alignment had long served Finnish national interests and was an important factor of confidence-building in the Baltic Sea region and the European continent as a whole,\" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement when Finland joined.\"This is now a thing of the past. Finland has become one of the small members of the alliance that doesn't decide anything, losing its special voice in international affairs. We are sure that history will judge this hasty step,” the statement continued.This is not the first time Western governments have accused Russia and its allies of encouraging asylum seekers to migrate as a part of their warfare tactics. Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia all say that they have faced a massive influx in asylum seekers on their borders with Belarus after the EU imposed sanctions on the country in 2020 in condemnation of its disputed election results. The Belarussian president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, confirmed that the decision to send asylum seekers was directly related to the EU’s decision to impose sanctions. \"(Sanctions) can have the opposite effect, which is shown by the reality of today's events on the Belarusian-Polish, Belarusian-Ukrainian, Belarusian-Lithuanian, and Belarusian-Latvian borders,\" he said in a news conference in August 2021.",

        "title_text": "Elon Musk Tells Advertisers Boycotting X to ‘Go F-ck Yourself’",
        "body_text": "Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, says the advertisers that have stopped spending on the platform due to his endorsement of an antisemitic post can “f——” themselves.“What it’s going to do is it’s going to kill the company, and the whole world will know the advertisers killed the company,” Musk said at the New York Times DealBook conference on Wednesday. “Go f—- yourself.”The post was the “worst and dumbest I’ve ever done,” said Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc.Still, if advertisers leave the company, its failure will be their fault, not his — saying they were trying to “blackmail me with money,” he said. “I won’t tap dance” to prove trustworthy, he said.Musk took the stage at the DealBook conference following a tumultuous few weeks for the world’s richest person, with a net worth of around $226 billion. Earlier this month, Musk agreed with a post that said Jewish people hold a “dialectical hatred” of white people. That message has since drawn criticism from the White House as well as several Tesla investors. Major corporate spenders, including Walt Disney Co. and Apple Inc., distanced themselves from the platform formerly known as Twitter. From the DealBook stage, Musk called out to “Bob” specifically, referring to Robert Iger, the CEO of Disney. Iger spoke at the event earlier in the day.For the first time since the post spurred a global backlash, Musk apologized for his choice of words. Musk, who flew to Israel to tour areas that were impacted by the Oct. 7 Hamas attack alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the trip was planned before the advertiser backlash. It wasn’t an “apology tour,” he said. Following his visit, he appeared on stage wearing a dog tag, which has become symbolic of a call for the return of hostages captured by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and E.U.Musk urged people to judge him by his actions rather than his words and brought up two companies he runs as justification. Tesla, he said, made more electric cars than competitors. SpaceX, formally named Space Exploration Technologies Corp., sends more satellites into space than any other company or country.“Hate me, like me or indifferent. Do you want the best car, or do you not want the best car?” he said. He said he’s done “more for the environment than any human.”Musk also addressed the inordinate amount of power that he wields given his market power in key industries such as cars, space, satellites and social media. The billionaire holds the keys to technological tools that provide him with political clout that world leaders have come to rely on.“The reason I have these powers isn’t because of anticompetitive actions but because we’ve executed well,” he said.Musk, who had been close to President Barack Obama, has had a contentious relationship with the Biden administration and said on Wednesday that he couldn’t see himself voting for President Joe Biden in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. He cited the president’s snub of Tesla, a reference to a 2021 electric vehicle summit where Biden invited legacy Detroit automakers to the White House lawn but left out Musk and Tesla. The brush off of the Musk-led automaker, which has 140,000 employees globally and is the world’s leading EV manufacturer, has remained a sore point for the billionaire. Since then, Musk has appeared to be leaning closer to the Republican party. In October, he appeared at a fundraiser for Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and in May Musk hosted Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on X as he announced his 2024 presidential campaign.Musk also bristled at the upswell of union activity at carmakers, which inked a record contract with the United Auto Workers union earlier this year after Biden showed up on the picket line to support unionized employees. Now, the UAW is going after Tesla. “I disagree with the idea of unions,” Musk said, noting that if the UAW’s unionization drive proves successful it’s because Tesla failed to provide a good enough working environment. If the EV maker’s plants are unionized, it’s because “we deserve it,” he said.The billionaire also addressed the debacle at Open AI, the maker of ChatGPT that Musk cofounded but later stepped down from. “I have mixed feelings about Sam,” Musk said about CEO Sam Altman, who was recently ousted and reinstated. “The ring of power can corrupt.” He said the public should know the reason Altman was fired, in case it has to do with some dangers of AI. “I don’t think it was trivial.”Musk is building a rival, called xAI, using the data from X, the social network. ",

        "title_text": "Israel and Hamas Extend Their War Truce for Another Day",
        "body_text": "Israel and Hamas agreed to lengthen their truce for at least another day, allowing for the release of more hostages held by the militant group in Gaza.The two sides announced the extension minutes before their cease-fire was due to end at 7 a.m. local time on Thursday, underscoring the fraught nature of the negotiations.The truce began on Nov. 24, marking the first halt in fighting since the war erupted on Oct. 7. That day, Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 captive.Read More: The Families of Israelis Held Hostage by Hamas Speak OutUnder the deal, Hamas frees some of those hostages each day, while Israel releases jailed Palestinians. In addition, Israel is allowing more aid into Gaza, where the United Nations says the humanitarian situation is “catastrophic” following Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes and a ground offensive.The talks have mainly been mediated by Qatar, with American and Egyptian involvement. The US welcomed the extension.“The process is producing results,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday in Tel Aviv, before meeting Israeli President Isaac Herzog. “It’s important and we hope it will continue.”Qatar said it will persist in its efforts to broker a permanent end to hostilities. The Gulf state was able, along with the US and Egypt, to mediate the initial truce agreement that went into effect Nov 24.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said the war will continue until Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by the US and European Union, is destroyed.“There is no situation in which we do not go back to fighting until the end,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday. “The entire security cabinet is behind it. The entire government is behind it. The soldiers are behind it. The people are behind it. This is exactly what we will do.”Hamas released 10 more hostages on Thursday — five children and five women, including dual nationals of the US, Germany and the Netherlands. Israel released 30 Palestinians from jails. In a separate deal, Hamas let go four Thai and two Russian-Israeli citizens.After the latest exchange, 145 hostages are still believed held in Gaza. It is not yet known how many of them are dead or are soldiers.More than 15,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry.While the cease-fire there continues to hold, there was a shooting attack in Jerusalem on Thursday. Residents of the eastern, mostly-Arab part of the city killed three people, before themselves being killed, Israeli police said.Herzog told Blinken it was another example of the “endless war that we are fighting against terror organizations, especially Hamas.”",

        "title_text": "Why China Fondly Remembers Henry Kissinger",
        "body_text": "Considered an unwavering American patriot to some and a warmonger to others, Henry Kissinger left an indelible and polarizing imprint across many parts of the globe. But the former U.S. Secretary of State, who died on Wednesday at the age of 100, is fondly remembered in China—scene of arguably his most seismic diplomatic success and where news of his passing has garnered warm tributes.China’s state broadcaster CCTV dubbed Kissinger—known locally as a “double centenarian” for both his age and the fact that he’d visited the Middle Kingdom 100 times—a “legendary diplomat,” highlighting his key role in establishing ties with Communist China in the heat of the Cold War. Xie Feng, China’s ambassador to the U.S, posted on X that Kissinger’s death was “a tremendous loss for both our countries and the world” and that “he will always remain alive in the hearts of the Chinese people as a most valued old friend.”The term “old friend” has special significance in China and is one that President Xi Jinping used to describe Kissinger during his latest (and last) visit in July. “Sino-U.S. relations will always be linked with the name of Henry Kissinger,” Xi said. On Thursday, Xi sent his personal condolences to the White House, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. Even before Nixon entered the White House in early 1969, he had been interested in repairing relations with China, leveraging schisms in the Sino-Soviet relationship to further contain his Cold War adversary in Moscow. By late 1970, Nixon and Kissinger—first appointed his National Security Adviser, a role he later combined with Secretary of State—were ramping up efforts to establish communication with “Great Helmsman” Mao Zedong. But headwinds such as the U.S. invasion of Cambodia hampered progress fostering a dialogue.Kissinger’s efforts relied on using Pakistan as an intermediary—though he also tried Romania and mutual contacts of China’s Embassy in Paris—and in December 1970 Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai responded to a cable from Pakistan President Yahya Khan to say that “a special envoy of President Nixon's will be most welcome in Peking.”Both sides engaged in important signaling during the spring of 1971, with Nixon publicly stating his interest in visiting China and the two countries exchanging table tennis players in what was dubbed “Ping Pong diplomacy.” By July 1971, Kissinger was secretly dispatched to Beijing for the first meaningful discussion with Zhou on mending the myriad divisions—not least over the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam—that had blighted relations over the years.As with today, Taiwan’s status was the burning issue that Kissinger had to tactfully address and upon which the success of his mission ultimately rested. The island had effectively split from China following the flight of the routed U.S.-backed Nationalists of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek across the Strait at the culmination of the nation’s 1927-1949 civil war—Chiang would go on to rule Taiwan until his death in 1975—and it hosted thousands of American troops. Even though the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had never ruled the island, which had only been sparsely inhabited by the Qing Dynasty and had been ruled as a Japanese colony from 1895 until 1945, its sovereignty then, just as now, was considered a red line.  While Kissinger resisted Zhou’s insistence that “Taiwan was a part of China,” he nevertheless conceded that “we are not advocating a ‘two Chinas’ solution or a ‘one China, one Taiwan’ solution,” according to official documents. This prompted Zhou to say for the first time that he was optimistic about Sino-U.S. rapprochement: “the prospect for a solution and the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries is hopeful.” In response, Kissinger told Zhou that he expected that Beijing and Washington would “settle the political question” of diplomatic relations “within the earlier part of the President’s second term.”It was sufficient for Mao to green-light Richard Nixon’s history-making trip to China in the spring of 1972, which fomented a “tacit alliance,” as Kissinger put it, in place of more than two decades of bristling hostility. In China, Nixon agreed what became known as the Shanghai Communiqué, which stated the U.S. formally “acknowledge” that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China.” (Although the CCP frequently and opportunistically misinterpret his “acknowledge” as “accept.”) However, downgrading relations with Taipei proved prohibitively contentious for the Republican Party, with Nixon's ignominious resignation in 1974 and the political weakness of his successor, Gerald Ford, delaying the formal diplomatic switch to Beijing until January 1979.For China, that changed everything. Just a few weeks later, its then paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, flew to Washington. Mending relations with the U.S. formed the bedrock for his market-led “reform and opening” economic liberalization drive—one that continued to face significant resistance from hardliners inside the CCP. Deng had bet everything on that trip and didn’t hold back, visiting the headquarters of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, Boeing in Seattle, before infamously donning a 10-gallon cowboy hat at a Texas rodeo. Even before he touched down, Deng reportedly told an aide on the flight: “As we look back, we find that all of those countries that were with the United States have been rich, whereas all of those against the United States have remained poor. We shall be with the United States.”Whether China is still “with” the U.S. today is a contentious question, though the prosperity that Deng’s visit unleashed is undeniable. China’s export-led boom that followed transformed it into the world’s No. 2 economy and top trading nation. Internally, some 800 million Chinese have been lifted out of extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. China is set to contribute 22.6% of global GDP growth over the next five years—twice as much as the U.S.—and is the top trading partner to the majority of the world.In the interim, the U.S. and China have faced and overcome difficulties in their relationship, not least the hundreds of peaceful protesters killed in the streets surrounding Tiananmen Square in 1989, and the U.S.’s accidental bombing of China’s Embassy in Belgrade 10 years later. Still, in recent years repression against ethnic Tibetans and Uyghur Muslims in China’s far west, as well as the leaching of freedoms in semiautonomous Hong Kong, have become escalating issues of contention—ones that have taken on fresh impetus as the Cold War foundation for that initial rapprochement crumbled away.After all, the detente between Washington and Beijing was always rooted not in mutual appreciation but shared enmity of the Soviet Union. With its gaze firmly on undermining Moscow, Washington was willing to engage with Beijing in the hope that China would reform, open up, and democratize. But the latter never happened. The status of Taiwan, just as when Kissinger sat down with Zhou over a half-century ago, remains the most combustive issue, with President Joe Biden vowing four times to defend the island from Chinese aggression. Xi has other plans. “China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable,” Xi told Biden in San Francisco earlier this month. Just how bad things may get is a question that worried Kissinger to the end—that the famed pragmatist’s greatest success may now be hurtling toward disaster. “I think some military conflict is probable,” Kissinger told Bloomberg grimly in June in one of his last interviews. “The current trajectory of relations must be altered.” So feared the man who first set their course.",

        "title_text": "Alistair Darling, U.K.’s Financial Crisis Chancellor, Dies at 70",
        "body_text": "Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, who oversaw Britain’s economy during the 2008 global financial crisis, has died at the age of 70. “Darling, the much-loved husband of Margaret and beloved father of Calum and Anna, died in Edinburgh this morning after a short spell in Western General Hospital under the wonderful care of the cancer team,” his spokeswoman said. Darling served under former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown from 2007 to 2010. His calmness and even temper stood in contrast to Brown’s abrupt mood changes during one of the worst periods of economic tumult in 30 years.When the US subprime mortgage crisis spread to the U.K., causing a liquidity crisis in the banking industry and triggering a run on the British bank Northern Rock, Darling allowed the Bank of England to bail it out.His stint in the Treasury ended when Labour lost the general election in 2010. Darling later led the Better Together campaign, a cross-party group that successfully campaigned for Scotland to remain part of the U.K. in the 2014 independence referendum. Darling became a member of the upper House of Lords in 2015. “Alistair lived a life devoted to public service,” current Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said in a statement. “He will be remembered as the chancellor whose calm expertise and honesty helped to guide Britain through the tumult of the global financial crisis. He was a lifelong advocate for Scotland and the Scottish people and his greatest professional pride came from representing his constituents in Edinburgh.”After becoming a member of Parliament in 1987, Darling rose quickly through the Labour ranks and became a key ally of Tony Blair and Brown as they sought to modernize the party and transform it into New Labour, going on to win a landslide victory in 1997. “I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have benefited from Alistair’s counsel and friendship,” Starmer added. “He was always at hand to provide advice built on his decades of experience - always with his trademark wry, good humor.”",

        "title_text": "Why This New Book About Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Was Pulled From Dutch Bookshelves",
        "body_text": "The sale of a Dutch translation of Endgame, a British royals biography written by journalist Omid Scobie, has been halted after two members of the royal family were named as expressing concern about the skin color of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle’s son while she was pregnant, the book's author said.Markle, who is half Black and half white, told Oprah Winfrey in a 2021 interview, after she and her husband stopped working as royals and moved to California, that there were several “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born.” The couple declined to name any family member involved in the conversation.The controversy resurfaced again after British royal biographer Scobie released his book Endgame: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy’s Fight for Survival on Nov. 28. The English version of the book claims there were two people involved, but doesn’t identify the royals who made the comments, which Scobie said was because he was concerned about libel laws. TIME is also not naming them.However, the Dutch translation reportedly unveiled the names, leading to a temporary withdrawal of the book after its publication on Tuesday.The Dutch publisher wrote in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it “was forced to temporarily withdraw the book from the market because an error had occurred in the Dutch edition,” and said it would be available in bookstores on Dec. 8. The publisher’s managing director Anke Roelen told TIME in an email on Thursday that the company was investigating and had no further statements. The book’s Dutch translator, Saskia Peeters, told MailOnline from her home in Arnhem in the Netherlands that she didn’t add the names into the translation. “As a translator, I translate what is in front of me,” she reportedly told a journalist. “The names of the royals were there in black and white.” Scobie appeared on ITV’s This Morning and BBC’s Newsnight in the U.K. on Thursday to defend himself. He said the English version of the book—the only one he said he worked, edited and signed off on—did not name the royals, and that he didn’t see the translated versions of the text until they were released.Scobie told Newsnight host Victoria Derbyshire there was a full investigation going on into the events. He swore “on my life and my family’s life” that it was not a publicity stunt aimed at driving attention to the book.  Scobie said beyond the controversy about names, the conversation about race was one “we’re not having enough of.” He said he wrote the book to examine whether the working family members uphold the same ethics, values and principles as the late Queen Elizabeth II, and if not, what needs to change. On Wednesday, British TV personality Piers Morgan named two royals on his program, risking legal action.Winfrey’s interview with the couple caused shockwaves at the time. In response to a reporter’s question afterwards about whether the royal family was racist, Harry’s brother, Prince William, said “we are very much not a racist family.”In a later interview with ITV, Harry denied an assumption that he and Meghan had accused his family of racism, saying he would not describe the incident as racist and pointed out there is a difference between racism and unconscious bias.Harry and Meghan stepped back from their senior duties as royals in 2020 and ceased to be working royals. The couple told Winfrey that the “bigoted” British tabloid media, which Harry has also accused of mistreatment of his late mother Princess Diana, was a large part of why they left.TIME has put in requests for comment to the palace press offices. ",

        "body_text": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli fighter jets hit targets in the Gaza Strip minutes after a weeklong truce expired on Friday, as the war with Hamas resumed in full force. Black smoke billowed from the besieged territory, and Israel dropped leaflets over parts of southern Gaza urging people to leave their homes, suggesting it was preparing to widen its offensive.In Israel, sirens warning of incoming rockets blared at several communal farms near Gaza, a sign that militants also restarted attacks, but there were no reports of hits. The renewed hostilities heightened concerns for Palestinians in the tiny coastal enclave as well as about 140 hostages who remain there, after more than 100 were freed during the truce.Qatar, which has served as a mediator along with Egypt, said negotiators were still trying to reach an agreement on restarting the cease-fire. Qatar's Foreign Ministry singled out Israel's role in the resumption of fighting and said it “complicates mediation efforts and exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe.\"A day earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli officials and urged them to do more to protect Palestinian civilians as they seek to destroy Hamas. Blinken arrived Friday at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, where he was to meet with Arab foreign ministers and other officials.Israel's retaliation for Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 raid has killed thousands of Palestinians dead, uprooted most of Gaza's 2.3 million people and led to a humanitarian crisis. Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are now crammed into the territory's south with no exit, raising questions over how any Israeli offensive there could avoid heavy civilian casualties.It was not clear to what extent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will heed the appeals of the United States, Israel’s most important ally. Netanyahu’s office said Friday that Israel “is committed to achieving the goals of the war: releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to the residents of Israel.”Only hours in to the renewed offensive, the Health Ministry of Hamas-controlled Gaza said 32 people had been killed and dozens wounded.In the leaflets it dropped in southern Gaza, Israel urged people to leave homes east of Khan Younis, warning that the southern town was now a “dangerous battle zone.” Other leaflets warned residents of several neighborhoods in Gaza City in the north to move south.The Israeli military also released a map carving up the Gaza Strip into hundreds of numbered parcels, and asked residents to learn the number associated with their location in case of an eventual evacuation. It was not immediately clear how Palestinians would be updated on calls for evacuation.Hundreds of thousands of people fled northern Gaza earlier in the war, in an extraordinary mass exodus that saw many take shelter in Khan Younis and other places in the south.One of the first airstrikes Friday destroyed a large building in Khan Younis. Moments later, residents were seen frantically searching the rubble for survivors as medics approached. One wounded person was carried away on a stretcher.In Hamad City, a Qatari-funded housing development near the city, a strike hit an apartment in a multi-story residential building, while other parts of the building appeared largely intact.Elsewhere, a strike hit a home near Gaza City in the north, and in the refugee camp of Maghazi, in central Gaza, rescuers clawed through the rubble of a large building hit by warplanes. A foot stuck out of the tangle of concrete and wiring.Israel has said it is targeting Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the group, accusing the militants of operating in residential neighborhoods. Since the war erupted Oct. 7, in response to a deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel, many of those killed in Israeli bombardments have been women and children.In Israel, white smoke trails could be seen in the skies over Sderot on the border with northern Gaza after Israel's missile protection systems activated.Netanyahu said the war resumed because Hamas had violated the terms of the truce. “It has not met its obligation to release all of the women hostages today and has launched rockets at Israeli citizens,” he said in a statement.Hamas blamed Israel for the end of the truce, saying in a statement that it had rejected all offers Hamas made to release more hostages and bodies of the dead.The Israeli military’s announcement of the resumption of strikes came only 30 minutes after the cease-fire, which began Nov. 24, expired early Friday.During the weeklong truce, Hamas and other militants in Gaza released more than 100 hostages, most of them Israelis, in return for 240 Palestinians freed from prisons in Israel.Virtually all of those freed were women and children, but the fact that few such hostages now remain in Gaza made it hard to reach a deal to extend the cease-fire.Hamas, a militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years, had been expected to set a higher price for the remaining hostages, especially Israeli soldiers.Netanyahu has been under intense pressure from families of the hostages to bring them home. But his far-right governing partners have also pushed him to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed, and could abandon his coalition if he is seen as making too many concessions.A total of 83 Israelis, including dual nationals, were freed during the truce, most of whom appeared physically well but shaken. Another 24 hostages — 23 Thais and one Filipino — were also released, including several men.The 240 Palestinians released were mostly teenagers accused of throwing stones and firebombs during confrontations with Israeli forces. Several were women who were convicted by military courts of attempting to attack soldiers.In its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 240 people captive.Since then, Israel’s bombardment and invasion in Gaza have killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, roughly two-thirds of them women and minors, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.The toll is likely much higher, as officials have only sporadically updated the count since Nov. 11. The ministry says thousands more people are feared dead under the rubble.Israel says 77 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence.",

        "title_text": "Who Will Be TIME’s Person of the Year for 2023? See the Shortlist",
        "body_text": "Editors are gearing up for the announcement of TIME’s 2023 Person of the Year—TIME’s annual selection of the individual, group, or concept that has had the most influence on the world throughout the previous 12 months. In a tradition that dates back to 1927, TIME’s Person of the Year is the annual designation for the person, group or concept that most shaped the headlines, for good or ill. Previous selections include U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Martin Luther King Jr., German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Pope Francis, and activist Greta Thunberg.  In 2022, TIME’s Person of the Year was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the “spirit of Ukraine.”  The 2023 Person of the Year will be announced on Wednesday morning.  Nine candidates, whose names were revealed Monday morning during NBC’s Today show, are in the running for TIME’s annual selection. Here are the finalists. Hollywood screenwriters and actors were on strike throughout the year, putting a pause on the creation and filming of new and current shows and movies—a rare show of the power of both labor and the entertainment industry. Both the ​​Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG)-AFTRA have resumed work; the WGA has already signed a new contract while SAG has a tentative agreement and has yet to ratify its new contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Chinese President Xi Jinping entered 2023 a few months into his unprecedented third term, solidifying his role as one of China’s most powerful modern leaders. Xi has been on the TIME100 list, which honors the 100 most influential global figures, more than 10 times. He was also a runner-up for TIME’s 2017 Person of the Year. Grammy-award winning artist Taylor Swift has had a major year, from re-releasing her albums with record-setting streams to making one of the most successful concert films in history. Swift’s Eras tour is also on track to become the highest-grossing global tour of all time. The pop star was previously on the 2017 Person of the Year cover, along with other “Silence Breakers” who spoke out against sexual misconduct. In the past few weeks alone, Sam Altman has made countless headlines for his departure (and swift return) to his position as CEO of OpenAI, the company that released the groundbreaking ChatGPT, which has defined today’s AI landscape. He was previously on the inaugural TIME100 AI list as well as the 2023 TIME100. Donald Trump became the first U.S. President to be indicted in the nation’s history, charged in four separate cases with more than 90 charges. Felony counts have been brought forward by prosecutors in Florida, Georgia, New York, and Washington, D.C., for election interference,  illegally holding on to classified documents, and falsifying business records.  Fans—especially women and girls—flocked to the cinema to see the first-ever live-action Barbie movie, the most highly-anticipated film of the year, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Greta Gerwig’s third feature was the highest-grossing film of 2023, earning $1.4 billion and causing an explosion of pink fashion, accessories, and other merchandise in stores across the world. The film made clear the possibility for theatrical success remains even in a streaming world.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has held the role of President or Prime Minister of Russia since 1999, continued to wage war in Ukraine, now in its second year after the full-scale invasion. Putin faced a brief threat to his power in 2023 during the Wagner rebellion, but his influence was only reinforced in the end, as the mercenary group retreated when a deal was struck by Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko. (Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner group, later died in a plane crash). Putin was TIME's 2007 Person of the Year and has been on the TIME100 list multiple times, including in 2022. After a decades-long wait for the throne, King Charles III took his position as the head monarch of the United Kingdom, and other territories, this May. At a moment of change for the monarchy, he signified the power of tradition. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was named Person of the Year when she ascended the throne in 1952.   Jerome Powell, who has been Chairman of the Federal Reserve since February 2018, has played a key role managing high inflation in the U.S., trying to architect the so-called “soft landing” of reducing inflation by raising interest rates without causing a recession—a goal felt in the wallets of Americans and economies across the world. He has been on the TIME100 list twice (in 2019 and 2020).",

        "title_text": "Police Raid Moscow Gay Bars After Court Labels LGBTQ+ Movement ‘Extremist,’ Says Local Media",
        "body_text": "Russian security forces raided gay clubs and bars across Moscow Friday night, less than 48 hours after the country’s top court banned what it called the “global LGBTQ+ movement” as an extremist organization.Police searched venues across the Russian capital, including a nightclub, a male sauna, and a bar that hosted LGBTQ+ parties, under the pretext of a drug raid, local media reported.Eyewitnesses told journalists that clubgoers’ documents were checked and photographed by the security services. They also said that managers had been able to warn patrons before police arrived.The raids follow a decision by Russia’s Supreme Court to label the country’s LGBTQ+ “movement” as an extremist organization.The ruling, which was made in response to a lawsuit filed by the Justice Ministry, is the latest step in a decadelong crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights under President Vladimir Putin, who has emphasized “traditional family values” during his 24 years in power.Activists have noted the lawsuit was lodged against a movement that is not an official entity, and that under its broad and vague definition authorities could crack down on any individuals or groups deemed to be part of it.Several LGBTQ+ venues have already closed following the decision, including St. Petersburg's gay club Central Station. It wrote on social media Friday that the owner would no longer allow the bar to operate with the law in effect.Max Olenichev, a human rights lawyer who works with the Russian LGBTQ+ community, told The Associated Press before the ruling that it effectively bans organized activity to defend the rights of LGBTQ+ people.“In practice, it could happen that the Russian authorities, with this court ruling in hand, will enforce (the ruling) against LGBTQ+ initiatives that work in Russia, considering them a part of this civic movement,” Olenichev said.Before the ruling, leading Russian human rights groups had filed a document with the Supreme Court that called the Justice Ministry lawsuit discriminatory and a violation of Russia’s constitution. Some LGBTQ+ activists tried to become a party in the case but were rebuffed by the court.In 2013, the Kremlin adopted the first legislation restricting LGBTQ+ rights, known as the “gay propaganda” law, banning any public endorsement of “nontraditional sexual relations” among minors. In 2020, constitutional reforms pushed through by Putin to extend his rule by two more terms also included a provision to outlaw same-sex marriage.After sending troops into Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin ramped up a campaign against what it called the West’s “degrading” influence. Rights advocates saw it as an attempt to legitimize the war. That same year, a law was passed banning propaganda of “nontraditional sexual relations” among adults, also, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ people.Another law passed this year prohibited gender transitioning procedures and gender-affirming care for transgender people. The legislation prohibited any “medical interventions aimed at changing the sex of a person,” as well as changing one’s gender in official documents and public records.Russian authorities reject accusations of LGBTQ+ discrimination. Earlier this month, Russian media quoted Deputy Justice Minister Andrei Loginov as saying that “the rights of LGBT people in Russia are protected” legally. He was presenting a report on human rights in Russia to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, arguing that “restraining public demonstration of nontraditional sexual relationships or preferences is not a form of censure for them.”The Supreme Court case is classified and it remains unclear how LGBTQ+ activists and symbols will be restricted.Many people will consider leaving Russia before they become targeted, said Olga Baranova, director of the Moscow Community Center for LGBTQ+ Initiatives.“It is clear for us that they’re once again making us out as a domestic enemy to shift the focus from all the other problems that are in abundance in Russia,” Baranova told the AP.",

        "title_text": "Philippine President Blames Militants for a Bombing That Killed 4 Worshippers at Catholic Mass",
        "body_text": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine president blamed “foreign terrorists” for a bomb blast that killed four people Sunday, wounded dozens of other Catholic worshippers in the south and sparked a security alarm, including in the capital, Manila, where state forces were put on alert.The suspected bomb, which the police said was made from a mortar round, went off and hit students and teachers who attended a Mass in a gymnasium at Mindanao State University in southern Marawi city, Taha Mandangan, the security chief of the state-run campus, told The Associated Press by telephone.Dozens of students and teachers dashed out of the gym and the wounded were taken to hospitals.Regional military commander Maj. Gen. Gabriel Viray III said four people were killed by the explosion, including three women, and 50 others were brought to two hospitals for treatment.Six of the wounded were fighting for their lives in a hospital, said Gov. Mamintal Adiong Jr. of the Islamic province of Lanao del Sur, which has Marawi as its capital.“I condemn in the strongest possible terms the senseless and most heinous acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists upon the Mindanao State University,” President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a statement. “Extremists who wield violence against the innocent will always be regarded as enemies to our society.”Marcos did not explain why he immediately blamed foreign militants for the high-profile bombing. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. later told a news conference without elaborating there was a strong indication of a “foreign element” in the bombing.Military chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said the bomb attack could be retaliation by Muslim militants for a series of battle setbacks.“We are looking at possible angles,” Brawner said. “It could be a retaliatory attack,”He cited the killing of 11 suspected Islamic militants in a military offensive backed by airstrikes and artillery fires on Friday near Datu Hoffer town in southern Maguindanao province.Regional police director Brig. Gen. Allan Nobleza said the slain militants belonged to Dawlah Islamiyah, an armed group that had aligned itself with the Islamic State group and still has a presence in Lanao del Sur province.Mosque-studded Marawi city came under attack from foreign and local Islamic militants who had associated themselves with the Islamic State group in 2017. The five-month siege left more than 1,100 dead, mostly militants, before it was quelled by Philippine forces backed by airstrikes and surveillance planes deployed by the United States and Australia.Army troops and police cordoned off the university shortly after the bombing and began an investigation, checking security cameras for any indication of who may have been responsible for the attack. Security checkpoints were set up around the city.Police Lt. Gen. Emmanuel Peralta told reporters that military and police bomb experts found fragments of a 60mm mortar round in the scene of the attack.Such explosives fashioned from mortar rounds had been used in past attacks by Islamic militants in the country’s south.The deadly blast set off a security alarm beyond Marawi city as the Christmas season ushered in a period of travel, shopping sprees and traffic jams across the country. Police and other state forces were put under “heightened alert” in metropolitan Manila, security officials said.The Philippine coast guard said it ordered all its personnel to intensify intelligence gathering, stricter inspections of passenger ferries and the deployment of bomb-sniffing dogs and sea marshals.\"Amid this barbaric act, best public service must prevail,” coast guard chief Admiral Ronnie Gavan said.The southern Philippines is the homeland of minority Muslims in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation and the scene of decades-old separatist rebellions.The largest armed insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, signed a 2014 peace deal with the government, considerably easing decades of fighting. But a number of smaller armed groups rejected the peace pact and press on with bombings and other attacks while evading government offensives.",

        "title_text": "With the Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Over, Agony Continues for Hostage Families",
        "body_text": "Efrat Machikawa is convinced every day that passes with her 79-year-old uncle in Hamas captivity is threatening his life. Her uncle is hard of hearing and suffers from high blood pressure and other conditions that depend on life-prolonging medication, she says, similar to other elderly hostages still in Gaza. After hearing about conditions of captivity from the testimonies of freed hostages—of surviving in dark tunnels with only rice and bread to eat—she fears that those who remain are dying. “This is why we have to make sure they come back tomorrow,” Machikawa tells TIME in a video call from southern Israel on Saturday evening. “If these people, the last vulnerable people inside and the innocent ones are not out, that will be hell, and we went through hell already.” “I'm ashamed we as the world haven't brought them back yet. They should be back.” Her uncle, Gadi Moses, was kidnapped by Hamas from his home in the kibbutz of Nir Oz on Oct. 7 after trying to calm down the militants, his family reported. His partner, Efrat Katz, was one of 1,200 people killed that day. His ex-wife and his partner’s daughter and two granddaughters were among the estimated 247 people abducted, but the four were released during a weeklong ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. During the truce, the families of 110 hostages celebrated the return of their loved ones, as did the families of 240 Palestinian prisoners released from Israel’s prisons in exchange. But fighting resumed on Dec. 1, with Israel continuing a bombing campaign that the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 17,000 people in Gaza.Amid the revived fighting, an estimated 136 hostages remain in Gaza, the Israeli government told the Associated Press on Dec. 1. Among them is Machikawa’s uncle, who is a father-of-three and grandfather to 10. Moses is a “happy, beautiful, kind and smart man,” she says, a multilingual “plant genius” and potato specialist who has helped communities all over the world grow food. Machikawa tells TIME “we should cease again” to release more hostages and believes it is the responsibility of Israel and governments all over the world to do everything they can to free them. Governments should be “very, very creative,” she says, trusting that leaders will unite and consult to achieve their common goal. “I’m sure governments have the power to do so,” she said. Israel had previously said under the negotiated ceasefire that they would stop fighting for a day for every 10 additional hostages Hamas freed. But on Dec. 2, Israel pulled out of negotiation talks with Qatari mediators in Doha, with Hamas responding that there would be no further prisoner swap until the war ends and Palestinian prisoners are released, Al Jazeera reported.During the ceasefire, Hamas released 110 hostages—86 Israelis, some with dual citizenships, and 24 foreign nationals. The militant group previously freed four captives in October. Israel also said it rescued another hostage, a female Israeli soldier, during a Gaza ground operation.  Of those who remain in captivity, it’s not known who is alive. Israel announced on Dec. 1 that four hostages—56-year old Maya Goren, 86-year old Arye Zalmanovich, 54-year-old Ronan Engel, and 75-year-old Eliyahu Margalit—had died, the AP reported. The Israel Defense Forces also announced on Nov. 29 that it brought the body of 27-year-old Ofir Tzarfati back to Israel. Two other hostages have died in captivity since Oct. 7, the AP reported. A list of the remaining hostages still included the youngest, 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, his 4-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri, despite unverified reports from Hamas that they had died. On Nov. 29, Hamas’ military arm posted on Telegram that the three family members had been killed in an Israeli bombing. The IDF told TIME in an email that day that it was assessing the accuracy of the information. The IDF noted that the family members were kidnapped alive into Gaza and said “Hamas is wholly responsible for the security of all hostages in the Gaza Strip.” On Dec. 3, the IDF said in an email it had no update regarding Hamas’ report. It’s also unknown who is holding all the hostages, complicating their release. Qatar’s government told The Financial Times that there are roughly 40 hostages in Gaza not being held by Hamas, but instead by other militant groups. For families of the hostages, the weeklong ceasefire brought both hope and heartache.Machikawa said her family received a phone call on Nov. 24 that her aunt Margalit Moses, 78, who is Gadi’s ex-wife, was among the first round of hostages to be released. When they finally reunited at Wolfson Medical Center, “we all cried, one side was crying of joy and the other of worry and the rest of grief” thinking of her uncle and others still in captivity, Machikawa says. Her aunt has since been released from the hospital and is “slowly adjusting” to life after captivity with the help of “wonderful professionals.”“Her release is the hope,” Machikawa says, that if “they could do it for a few times, that means they can do it again, and again, and again until everybody comes back.” Two months after her uncle was kidnapped, time has lost its meaning for Machikawa. She’s exhausted from not resting and still haunted by the traumas of Oct. 7, where around one in four people in Nir Oz, the community her parents helped start, were killed or kidnapped. Others across the country have reported rapes. “I wish I could erase it from my memory,” Machikawa says of the reports, drawing in her breath as she wipes a tear from her eye. “What kind of a world lets monsters go away with that and not try to save them?”“It’s not complete until they’re all back,” she continues. “We will manage the grief of those who were murdered, we will manage to overcome the catastrophe, the atrocity we witnessed, we will manage, but it will be very difficult to really rise up unless everybody is back home.”   Still though, she believes the remaining hostages can come home. “I’m talking from great grief and sorrow and disappointment,” she says. “And though my voice is coming out of these deep, dark surroundings, I still see hope. We can still save them, so we have to save them tomorrow.” ",

        "title_text": "The Israel-Hamas War Reveals the Fundamental Flaws of Social Media",
        "body_text": "Today, the images and videos circulating, especially across social media, are offering a very poor representation of the truth of what happened on Oct. 7 in Israel. This is partly due to the Israeli government’s understandable efforts to protect the privacy and dignity of the victims, and abstaining from publishing evidence of the atrocities committed to the public. At the same time, the content that is flooding social platforms now reveals that something is fundamentally broken in how millions of people around the world are consuming information about the events of the Hamas Massacre and the subsequent Israel-Hamas War. Rightly, there is ample heart-wrenching footage from Gaza across social media platforms amidst significant civilian casualties; but there is also sadly rampant misinformation fomenting anger, and extremist antisemitic and Islamophobic hate alike, on those platforms. The problem appears particularly prevalent on TikTok, whose short-video format is not wholly conducive to providing accurate, verifiable context. The fact that pro-Palestinian hashtags on TikTok have more reach than 10 top mainstream news sites from across the political spectrum combined, according to research conducted by data scientist Anthony Goldbloom, may not sound particularly disturbing on its own. And likewise with the fact there are 54 views of videos with pro-Palestinian hashtags for every view of a TikTok video with a pro-Israel hashtag in the U.S. or that #freepalestine is one of the top-performing hashtags across all of TikTok. But what is disturbing is that even a cursory scroll through these TikTok videos and “Photo Mode” on a random search reveals what many argue is rampant atrocity-denying antisemitic content. Some of those many examples can be seen in this catalogue by Jonathan Greenblatt’s Anti-Defamation League, with some posts blatantly denying any atrocities occurred or peddling antisemitic tropes. These posts are still pervasive even though TikTok claims that they have beefed up their content moderation team, removing millions of videos promoting Hamas, hate speech, terrorism, and misinformation. Unfortunately, their content moderators may still be outgunned with even TikTok acknowledging that they have “seen spikes in fake engagement” as well as a “rise in content promoting terrorism” in unprecedented scale and scope. TikTok recently spoke out after videos promoting Osama bin Laden’s “Letter to America” racked up millions of views on the app. Written by the former Al Qaeda leader in 2002, the letter heavily criticized the U.S. and attempted to justify the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In a statement, TikTok said: “Content promoting this letter clearly violates our rules on supporting any form of terrorism. We are proactively and aggressively removing this content and investigating how it got onto our platform.”Further suggesting that TikTok’s content moderators can barely keep up with the sheer volume of misinformation is the fact that graphic videos produced by Hamas celebrating terrorism have garnered millions of views, despite nominal bans, according to Steven Brill and Gordon Crovitz of NewsGuard.Perhaps, then, it is not entirely surprising that one survey by Generation Lab found that even though much questionable TikTok content emerges from overseas countries such as Pakistan and Qatar, spending 30 minutes a day on TikTok increases, by nearly 20%, the chances an average U.S. respondent holds antisemitic views. TikTok’s defense, that the attitudes of many TikTok users, particularly young people, are pro-Palestinian long before the video-sharing app existed does not inspire confidence amidst what Deborah Lipstadt, President Biden’s Special Envoy for Antisemitism, calls a “gobsmacking” rise of instances of antisemitism.  Lest anyone think that antisemitism is the only form of hate speech on social media, TikTok competitor Instagram, owned by Meta, has drawn fire for allegations of systemic Islamophobia and unfairly discriminating against Arabic content posters. According to the Wall Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz, and confirmed by Meta’s own internal reports, Meta’s automated content moderation tools have long struggled to parse different Arabic dialects, in particular the Palestinian Arabic dialect. In one particularly egregious recent glitch, Instagram’s automatic translations started censoring innocuous content by accidentally, unjustly rendering the word “Palestinian” along with an emoji as “Palestinian terrorists.” In response to these incidents, Meta was forced to apologize for translation glitches and acknowledged that they are in the process of improving their algorithms. X, formerly known as Twitter, has drawn scrutiny for its own numerous stumbles. NewsGuard recently found that blue-checked, “verified” users on X produce a startling 74% of the platform’s most viral false and unsubstantiated claims peddling both antisemitic denials of atrocities as well as doctored footage meant to stoke Islamophobia. X responded by issuing an ad hominem attack against NewsGuard, with owner Elon Musk tweeting, “NewsGuard is a propaganda shop that will produce any lies you want if you pay them enough money” echoing Musk’s earlier call for NewsGuard to be “disbanded immediately,” though NewsGuard stands by their substantive data findings. Furthermore, Media Matters published a report finding that X placed corporate advertisements for companies such as Apple, Bravo, IBM, Oracle, and Comcast next to pro-Nazi, antisemitic, and Islamophobic content. Although X denied these claims and filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, Musk’s recent taunt to advertisers of “Go f--k yourself” at Andrew Ross Sorkin’s Dealbook Summit does not exactly inspire confidence in X’s practices.Sure, cynics could point out that social media platforms have long struggled with how to police misinformation across a variety of issues ranging from vaccine conspiracies to election meddling to teen risks. But the distortions surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the rampant antisemitism and Islamophobic hate they have spurred, strikes at something more fundamental.80 years ago, when Allied troops liberated the emaciated, diseased skeletal survivors of Nazi concentration camps, Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight Eisenhower insisted on having international press see the horrors of the Holocaust with their own eyes to preempt the propaganda of historical denialism. As Eisenhower wrote, “the visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty, and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me sick… we made the visit deliberately in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to ‘propaganda.’”Now, with rampant denial of Hamas’ atrocities on the rise, Eisenhower’s warning seems especially prescient as this is not an abstract debate over preferred statistical methodology or about competing intellectual theory. Much as how historian Tim Snyder and Special Envoy for Antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt have called out Holocaust deniers as perpetuating fraud, or when Pulitzer Prize winning historian David Blight called out slavery deniers as fraudulent, there is such a thing as the truth, and there is such a thing as evil. Each should be clearly recognized as such with no ambiguity.",

        "title_text": "The Lesson Israel Must Learn From America’s Fight in Fallujah",
        "body_text": "The Battle of Fallujah, fought almost exactly nineteen years ago in Iraq, is a central part of Marine Corps lore. But what everyone is actually remembering is the Second Battle of Fallujah. The First Battle of Fallujah ended in embarrassment: Marines occupied a quarter of the city only to call it off after five days because of rising civilian casualties. It was a remarkable moment of contrition and self-criticism for the Marine Corps.Yet that pause made possible a new strategy that brought victory the second time around.Last week’s truce offered Israel a similar opportunity: to change its strategy to one that will not just win the war, but win the peace. As U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, himself a veteran of Iraq, said recently, “In this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”So far, the signs in Gaza are not promising. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have resumed a strategy of heavy bombardment against the very areas where they told Palestinians from Northern Gaza to evacuate to safety.Flashback to Fallujah, the Marines recognized that the war had changed from the early days of the Iraq invasion. No longer were we fighting a traditional military-on-military battle, but rather a counterinsurgency fight against militants operating amongst, and recruiting from, the civilian population. In the six months between that first Fallujah failure and second victory, Marines made a civilian evacuation and intensive humanitarian aid central to their military strategy, separating innocents from militants.Dropping leaflets, broadcasting announcements and, critically, providing safe passage and safe haven, the Marines evacuated civilians from Fallujah so effectively that, by the time they went back in, up to 90% of the city had left. Only the hardened insurgents remained to be eliminated.Marines learned the importance of not just defeating the insurgents—but winning over everyone else. Iraqis had a choice: join the insurgency or bet on the Marines and sit it out. This is when the Marines adopted our now-proud slogan: “No better friend, no worse enemy, than a U.S. Marine.” Being a good friend comes first.Israel needs to learn that Palestinians have a similar choice. A survey just before the October 7th attacks found that 67 percent of Palestinians in Gaza had little or no trust in Hamas, so it was fertile ground for Israel to prove they have a common enemy in Hamas.That’s why Israel has not just a moral problem with how many innocents have died in this conflict already, but a serious military problem as well. Famed U.S. General Stanley McChrystal called this problem “insurgent math.” He estimated that for every single innocent civilian killed, the insurgency recruits ten new adherents.One of General McChrystal’s aides in Afghanistan calculated that at the beginning of that war there were 1,500 to 2,000 insurgents. Four years later, there were 30,000 to 35,000. A 2010 report found that for each incident involving civilian casualties in Afghanistan, there would be at least one additional violent clash in that same district over the next six weeks. The authors referred to this as the 'revenge' effect.One of the most difficult conversations of my life was the day my faithful translator came to our base and tried to quit because insurgents had come to his home and threatened his family: stop working for the Americans or we’ll kill you all. Knowing the importance of our work, I convinced him to defy the threats, but it was literally my word as a U.S. Marine versus the insurgent “recruiters” who came to his home.If Israel is to avoid this insurgency dilemma in future combat operations, it must do so in a way that better protects civilians as a core strategic objective, choosing not to fight where civilians are present, and devoting time, resources, and manpower to evacuating civilians while surging aid to the places they are going. The IDF must also tighten their rules of engagement and be more discriminating in their use of air power and artillery. As we have learned from experience, doing so saves lives and it weakens the insurgents when loosely affiliated militants leave instead of risking getting killed themselves.Admitting mistakes doesn’t come easily to Marines. It comes even harder to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And yet, he made an important admission of a both moral and military mistake when he recently stated that Israel was “not successful” at limiting civilian deaths in Gaza.Now he should follow the Marines’ lead and not just admit a mistake, but do something about it. That’s the way to win.",

        "title_text": "23 Hikers Confirmed Dead After Indonesia’s Mount Marapi Erupts",
        "body_text": "Twenty-three people have died after a volcano erupted in West Sumatra, Indonesia, on Sunday. Bodies of all the victims have been found, though not yet all identified, local authorities confirmed Wednesday, after the last missing climber was located a few yards away from the eruption site.Video footage showed plumes of ash spluttering 9,800 ft. into the air around Mount Marapi—one of the nation’s 127 active volcanoes—over the weekend. Seventy-five hikers were in the vicinity when the 9,485 ft. volcano erupted.Initially, 49 people were evacuated to shelter, and rescuers evacuated another three survivors found near the crater later on Monday.“Some suffered from burns because it was very hot, and they have been taken to the hospital,” Rudy Rinaldi, head of the West Sumatra Disaster Mitigation Agency, told Agence France-Presse of the rescued hikers. “Those who are injured were the ones who got closer to the crater.”Ten climbers remained missing as of Tuesday but were presumed dead because of their proximity to the eruption, West Sumatra deputy police chief Edi Mardianto said. By Wednesday, West Sumatra police chief Suharyono told reporters, 20 bodies had been taken to hospital for identification. As of Tuesday evening, only 11 of the dead had been identified.Efforts to retrieve bodies have been hampered amid continuous eruptions. “Marapi is still very much active. We can’t see the height of the column because it’s covered by the cloud,” Ahmad Rifandi, the head of a monitoring station at the volcano, told AFP on Tuesday, adding that there were five eruptions from midnight to 8 a.m. local time.The mother of Zhafirah Zahrim Febrina, a hiker who is receiving treatment in hospital, told AFP her daughter has incurred “tremendous trauma.” Rani Radelani, 39, said: “She is affected psychologically because she saw her burns, and she also had to endure the pain all night.”Efforts to locate remaining missing hikers were paused on Monday following another smaller eruption. “It’s too dangerous if we continue searching now,” said Jodi Haryawan, a spokesman for the search and rescue team. Local residents are forbidden from going within 3 km (1.86 mi.) of the crater, and officials have confirmed that climbing routes have been closed. Since 2011, the volcano has been placed on the third highest alert level on a four-level scale. But officials raised it to the second highest alert level in the aftermath of Sunday’s eruption.  Hikers were prohibited from attempting to reach the peak, but according to Hendra Gunawan, the head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, some hikers “broke the rules to fulfill their satisfaction to climb further.”Marapi’s last eruption, which took place in April 1979, was its deadliest, having killed 60 people. Sumatra is part of Indonesia’s archipelago, located on the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” where tectonic plates can converge and invite high volcanic and seismic activity. National Geographic notes that around 90% of all earthquakes take place along the ring, while 75% of the earth’s active volcanoes are located in the region.",

        "title_text": "The Philippines Accuses China of ‘Swarming’ Reef Off Its Coast. Here’s What to Know",
        "body_text": "Some 135 Chinese vessels were spotted near Whitsun Reef off the coast of the western Philippine island province of Palawan this weekend. Although it remains unclear exactly what the vessels are doing there, experts tell TIME that it’s likely the latest Chinese display of maritime power in the hotly contested waters of the South China Sea. “The whole idea is to project presence,” says Collin Koh, an expert in naval affairs at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “That, ‘I'm there and there's nothing you can do to chase me away.’”Here’s what we know about the Chinese boats.Commodore Jay Tarriela, a spokesperson for the Philippines coast guard, said the vessels were spotted in the Whitsun Reef, known locally as the Julian Felipe Reef. In response, National Security Adviser Eduardo Año ordered the coast guard to patrol the area and challenge what he called the “illegal presence” of the Chinese vessels there. Under international maritime law, the Philippines has sovereign rights over waters 200 nautical miles off the coast, which the Whitsun Reef falls within.Read More: China Is Testing How Hard It Can Push in the South China Sea Before Someone Pushes BackMore than a dozen of the vessels were reportedly rafted together. Koh says this is either to weather strong conditions at sea or thwart law enforcement forces, with the other scattered hulls securing the perimeter of the reef.It’s not clear what the vessels are doing there—China has yet to comment on them. According to Tarriela’s statement, the PCG radioed the Chinese vessels swarming about, but they received no response.China has laid claim to virtually all of the South China Sea, a waterway that carried $3.4 trillion in global trade in 2016. Wary of inviting criticism and invoking armed conflict, analysts say China resorts to “gray zone” tactics: responses that fall short of what constitutes an armed attack. In 2023, the Philippines had reported China’s use of a bevy of these tactics, from military-grade lasers and water cannons to Chinese ships threatening to hit Philippine boats.Jay Batongbacal, a maritime security expert based in the Philippines, also tells TIME that in anchoring ships in contested areas, China deprives local communities of their livelihoods through intimidation.“They are effectively denying other countries like us of our presence in the area that they are imposing themselves on,” Batongbacal says. “They're probably hoping that the Philippines will simply concede these areas to China.” Asia-Pacific nations have been pushing back against China, particularly the Philippines, which won a 2016 ruling from the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration when the court dismissed China's claim to much of the South China Sea. Read More:Why the Philippines May Take China to Court—Again—Over the South China SeaUnder President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the Philippines has also resorted to more public criticisms of China’s actions in the disputed waterways. “It also helps in a way to not just deter the Chinese,” Koh says, “but also impose a certain reputational cost on the Chinese.” The Philippines has sought closer military ties to the U.S. to counter China. Last month, the two countries launched joint maritime patrols amid what Marcos Jr. called a “dire” situation in the disputed sea. ",

        "title_text": "Russia’s Court Ban of the ‘LGBTQ Movement’ Is the Latest Global Move Against Inclusion",
        "body_text": "Russia’s Supreme Court has moved to classify the “international LGBT social movement” as an extremist organization in the latest global move against LGBTQ+ inclusivity. The Thursday ruling criminalizes not just any activist working to advance human rights for queer individuals, but could also enable prosecutors to target anyone who supports LGBTQ+ people. The move is causing activists to warn of a possible rise in arrests and reduction in the limited positive coverage of LGBTQ+ individuals. “If you speak at all about LGBT rights, whether you do it by protesting peacefully, or just posting comments on social media by saying anything in public, anything at all, you're going to be in trouble,” says Tanya Lokshina, associate director for Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division.Research from the Pew Research Center indicates a worldwide trend toward increased public support for the legalization of same-sex marriage throughout the past decade, but attitudes about the LGBTQ+ community still vary vastly in different countries—92% of Swedes are in favor of same-sex marriage, compared to just 2% of Nigerians. Experts tell TIME many elected officials across the world, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, have advocated for anti-LGBTQ+ legislation as a way to differentiate their country from the West, which Putin said has “rather strange, in my view, new-fangled trends like dozens of genders, and gay parades.” But even in countries that have been moving towards broader LGBTQ+ acceptance, there seems to be pushback, with a rise in hate crimes reported in the U.S. and France. “We continue to see that with every social justice movement the more advances you make, the stronger the resistance gets,” says Tuisina Ymania Brown, co-secretary general of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). Russia does not explicitly criminalize same-sex relationships or differing forms of gender expression, but their laws largely limit the rights of people whose gender identity or relationships fall out of so-called traditional norms. This year, there’s been an expansion of those policies through a law banning gender reassignment surgery and legal gender recognition.Because what the Russian Supreme Court labeled the “international LGBT social movement” is not an actual organized, legal group, activists and anyone who speaks out in support of the queer community in Russia and abroad could face punishment, says A. Chaber (A is how they identify their first name) executive director of ILGA Europe. People who participate or finance what the government labels an  “extremist organization” can face up to 12 years in prison, Human Rights Watch reports. Those who display symbols of an “extremist organization,” which include pride flags, could be arrested for up to 15 days, Chaber wrote to TIME in an email. Repeat offenders could be subject to up to four years in prison. Lokshina warns that even those suspected of association with an “extremist group” could see their bank accounts frozen. And, even worse, old social media posts could also make you liable to punishment. “The reason that this is likely to happen is that Russian authorities have been misusing the country's broad and very vague anti extremists legislation to prosecute critics for a long long time,” Lokshina adds. She points to instances where officials arrested people for their social media posts supporting political opposition figure Alexei Navalny, as evidence of this possibility. “In essence, it means if you live in Russia, and you're gay if you live in the closet they are not going to bother you. But if you make a single step, a tiny step out of that closet, you are at risk,” she says.Lokshina says politicians often say hateful things toward queer individuals as a way to “boost the conservative base of support.” But it also poses “insurmountable obstacles for LGBT rights activists.”“More and more sexual and gender minorities are facing attacks from opponents consisting of fake narratives, fake news, lies, propaganda, and other forms of misinformation and disinformation,” Brown says. That can easily be done in countries like Russia, where elected officials moved to expand an existing gay propaganda ban that was put in place in 2013. “That heinous piece of legislation was toughened even further to extend from supposedly protecting children from harmful information,” Lokshina says. But in practice, she says, it prohibits children from seeing any positive queer representation across art, culture, education, etc. “It blatantly perpetuates this false messaging, very damaging messages, by trying to link LGBT people with pedophiles as there are repeated references in the legislation to propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations, and pedophilia,” says Lokshina. It's a political tactic that dates back decades and is also becoming increasingly common in the U.S.“Politicians just want power and more power, and they'll ride on the coattails of anti-LGBTI sentiments to get into office,” Brown adds. Efforts to limit inclusion have seen increasing funding. A 2021 report from the Global Philanthropy Project found that from 2013-2017, LGBTQ+ movements worldwide received $1.2 billion in funding compared to the anti-gender movement, which received $3.7 billion. Currently, 67 countries criminalize same-sex relations by adults, according to Human Rights Watch. Brown notes that there has been progress in some countries, including Antigua, Barbuda, and the Cook Islands, which recently decriminalized gay sex. A similar overturning of a colonial-era law was seen in Singapore (though parliament later amended the constitution to ensure that there would not be any court challenges that could lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage, Reuters reports).But the movement towards LGBTQ+ rights is not linear in many countries. This push and pull has been seen in Spain, which passed a law allowing transgender people aged 16 and up to change their legal gender without a medical evaluation of court approval in February. The law was heralded by queer activists, but far-right politicians attempted to thwart that rule months later, while also pushing for broader parental rights in schools to exempt their children from certain lessons—similar to what has been seen in conservative states in the United States. In Italy, a state prosecutor demanded the removal of the non-biological mothers’ names on their child’s birth certificate for lesbian couples this June. And in the U.S., there has been a record number of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation introduced targeting the right to perform drag and access gender-affirming services. An International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association-Europe report found that 2022 was the most violent year for LGBTI people in the past decade due to increasing hate “speech from politicians, religious leaders, right-wing organizations and media pundits.” The report cited increased murder and suicide rates across countries that were seen as more progressive. But even globally, the 2023 Trans Murder Monitoring Report found that 321 trans and gender diverse people were murdered in the last year alone, nearly the same as last year’s record. “This deliberate dissemination of fake news between trans people as a threat to children, or cis women, has gained significant traction, contributing to the trans community’s stigmatization and discrimination oftentimes, very violent,” Brown says.

        "title_text": "What to Know About Israel’s Expanding Ground Assault in Gaza",
        "body_text": "Gazans are facing new mass evacuation notices after the Israeli military said on Sunday that its ground assault in Gaza had expanded to include all of the Palestinian enclave. On Monday, Israeli forces urged residents to evacuate central Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis, which has since faced a campaign of heavy bombing. The IDF has posted an illustrative map with numbered conflict zones on social media, telling Palestinians to head south towards Rafah, which has also faced bombardment, or to the West of the strip. \"The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) continues to extend its ground operation against Hamas centers  in all of the Gaza Strip,\" spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters in Tel Aviv. \"The forces are coming face-to-face with terrorists and killing them,” Hagari added. Israel’s government spokesperson, Eylon Levy, claimed that the military has struck over 400 targets.The Jabaliya refugee camp is also among Israel’s renewed targets. But locals—many of whom have already been evacuated from the North—say there are no safe places left to go. OCHA estimates that 1.8 million people have now been displaced in Gaza, amounting to 75% of the population. The move comes two days after a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas broke down on Friday, with both sides blaming each other for breaching the deal. During the seven-day pause, 105 hostages were released by Hamas, in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and children who were held in Israeli prisons. On Sunday, Ismael al-Thawabteh, the director general of Gaza's governmental media office, told Al Jazeera that as many as 700 Palestinians had been killed in a 24-hour period. As such, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said that a total of 15,523 Palestinians have been confirmed killed since Israel began its bombardment of Gaza. In Israel, 1200 were killed on Oct. 7 alongside  248 who were taken hostage by Hamas. As the ground attack intensifies, here’s what to know about Israel’s latest evacuation orders.Israel initially dropped leaflets telling residents to evacuate the Southern Gaza area which is already hosting over 1.1 million refugees who fled from the North during the Israeli operation in Gaza city. Dina Matar, the chair of center for Palestine studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said that the initial evacuation orders were difficult for civilians to understand. “The original leaflets had a QR code that they would have to use their phone to access and then read a very–almost dystopian–numbered map of Gaza,” says Matar. In the map, Gaza was divided into hundreds of numbered districts, with different areas designated as safe or unsafe. With internet connection being sporadic since the beginning of the war and electricity access highly limited, Matar says the map was inaccessible to many ordinary Gazans. Additionally, for the people who were able to access the map, the numerical labeling of the areas was difficult to understand. “Even for someone who knows every single neighborhood, it is difficult to navigate that map,” she says. Matar says that Israel has updated the leaflets today and since dropped leaflets naming specific regions in the west and south of Gaza for residents to flee to, but the complicated logistics of packing up and finding transport make it impossible for many. “Expecting people to move collectively, in a short period of time is difficult, given the fact that people don't have many forms of transport except on foot or maybe on donkeys,” she says.Even in the places that civilians have been encouraged to evacuate to, like Rafah in the South, there have been reports of Israeli bombs being dropped in civilian areas. Food and clean water are also hard to come by in the strip, where aid trucks have been unable to meet the demand of a population of over two million people. During the truce between Israel and Hamas, which lasted one week, approximately 200 aid trucks entered the strip per day from Egypt. However, since the truce ended on Friday, the number of aid trucks permitted to enter has decreased. The Palestinian Red Cross last confirmed it had received 100 aid trucks on Saturday, Dec. 2 but has not announced receiving any aid trucks since. “Clean water is a rare commodity,” says Matar. “People have to queue up and fill up cans of water in order for them to be able to drink it, use it for cooking, and things like that.”Many of the displaced people who fled during Israel’s operation in the Northern part of the strip who were not able to find relatives or friends in the South who could open their homes to them are living in tents and using communal facilities. “People have to queue up to use facilities like the toilet, it's a very rudimentary arrangement,” says Matar. Residents have also been lacking essential medicines since the start of the war. In the South hospitals have been performing operations without anesthetics since October. The World Health Organization has warned that eventually disease will kill more people than the bombs as basic sanitation becomes impossible to maintain. Diarrheal diseases are extremely common among populations living in crowded living conditions with unclean water, and are responsible for 15% of child deaths around the globe. \"Everybody everywhere has dire health needs now because they're starving because they lack clean water and (they’re) crowded together,\" the WHO's Margaret Harris said at a U.N. briefing in Geneva on Nov. 28, referring to the situation in Gaza.",

        "title_text": "Sheryl Sandberg Calls for More Outrage Over Attacks on Women on Oct. 7",
        "body_text": "Sheryl Sandberg, the high profile former Meta executive, spoke alongside Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and several Israeli officials at an event designed to highlight the atrocities committed against women by Hamas during its attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, and to scold the international community for its silence on the issue. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also weighed in by video. “Rape should never be used as an act of war,” said Sandberg. “This truth must be upheld despite the politics of our time. Because no matter what marches you're attending, what flag you are flying, what religion you practice, or if you practice none at all, here's one thing we can all agree on: there are exactly no circumstances that justify rape.” Sandberg also aired her views in a video and wrote a column on the subject. The gathering, which was presented by Israel’s Permanent Mission to the U.N., brought together eyewitness accounts from first responders, those who had gathered and tended to the bodies of female victims after the Oct. 7 attacks, and advocates for women and for Israel—who scolded women’s organizations, and in particular UN Women, for not condemning the actions of Hamas more forcefully. (The organization released a statement “unequivocally condemn[ing] the brutal attacks by Hamas” on Dec. 1.)  “Only two days ago, nearly two months after Hamas’s massacre, has UN Women showed an ounce of recognition,” said Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations.Organizers showed video confessions of captured Hamas militants attesting to what they had seen, including rape and the violation of female corpses. Members of the Israeli Police Force and others who had dealt with bodies testified at the event as well. Shari Mendes, an American-born architect and Israel Defense Force reservist had the responsibility of preparing female soldiers’ bodies for burial. “Many young women arrived in bloody shredded rags or just in underwear and their underwear was often very bloody,” she said. “Our team commander saw several female soldiers who were shot in the crotch, intimate parts, vagina or shot in the breast.” A first responder, Simcha Grainimin, a volunteer with Israeli search and rescue operation ZAKA, testified, with difficulty, that he found a woman’s body with nails, and other objects, in her vaginal cavity. Hamas has denied that any rape took place on Oct. 7. Some speakers at the event, including Clinton, made efforts to appear neutral on the war. “I have grieved with Israeli women who have lost loved ones to terrorist attacks, but refused to believe that peace is impossible,” the former First Lady said. “I have talked and listened to Palestinian women who have suffered greatly from the conflicts of the past decades, yet dream of a peaceful future and a state of their own.”But many did not hide their belief that some women’s groups had not spoken up about the violence against women on Oct. 7 because of anti-semitism. Mandana Dayani, the Iranian born co-founder of I Am a Voter addressed the women’s groups with whom she had campaigned during the kidnapping of girls by Boko Haram, MeToo and in the women’s campaigns, who have been silent on the issue of Oct. 7. “What is it about these women and girls that makes them so unworthy of your otherwise limitless capacity for outrage, solidarity and justice?” asked Dayani. “Once again I'm afraid the reason is quite simple. Because they're Jews. If that is not the case, then now is the time to prove it.”Sandberg, who since leaving Meta has been working on philanthropic projects, is best known for championing women in the workplace with Lean In, but is also no stranger to activism on behalf of Israel. Her parents Joel and Adele were co-founders of the South Florida Conference on Soviet Jewry in the 70s, which raised awareness for the welfare of Jews in the then Soviet Union. In 2019, she gave $2.5 million to the Ant-Defamation League in honor of their 75th birthdays. But she was eager to frame this issue as one that affects all people. \"For over a decade, I've been urging women to lean in. Now I call on everyone to speak out,\" she said. \"Anyone who has a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife or a friend should join us to unite against rape.\" ",

        "title_text": "Former U.S. Diplomat Charged with Secretly Spying for Cuban Intelligence for Decades",
        "body_text": "MIAMI — A former career American diplomat was charged Monday with serving as a secret agent for communist Cuba going back decades in what prosecutors portrayed as one of the most brazen and long-running betrayals in the history of the U.S. foreign service.Court papers alleged that Manuel Rocha engaged in “clandestine activity” on Cuba's behalf since at least 1981, including by meeting with Cuban intelligence operatives and providing false information to U.S. government officials about his travels and contacts.The complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, charges Rocha with crimes including acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government and provides a vivid case study of what American officials say are long-standing efforts by Cuba and its notoriously sophisticated intelligence services to target government officials who can be flipped.“This action exposes one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the United States government by a foreign agent,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"To betray that trust by falsely pledging loyalty to the United States while serving a foreign power is a crime that will be met with the full force of the Justice Department.”The 73-year-old Rocha, whose two-decade career as a U.S. diplomat included top posts in Bolivia, Argentina and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, was arrested at his Miami home Friday. He wept as he sat handcuffed during his first court appearance Monday and was ordered held pending a bond hearing Wednesday. His attorney declined to comment.The Justice Department did not reveal how Rocha attracted the attention of Cuba’s intelligence operatives nor did it describe what, if any, sensitive information he may have provided while in government.Instead, the case relies largely on what prosecutors say were Rocha's own admissions, made over the past year to an undercover FBI agent posing as a Cuban intelligence operative.Rocha praised the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro as “Comandante,” branded the U.S. the “enemy” and bragged about his service for more than 40 years as a Cuban mole in the heart of the State Department and elite U.S. foreign policy circles, the complaint says.“What we have done … it’s enormous … more than a Grand Slam,” he was quoted as saying at one of several secretly recorded conversations starting last year at discrete locations — a church and outdoor food court — in downtown Miami.“They underestimated what we could do to them. We did more than they thought,” the document quotes Rocha as saying, referring to the United States.To cover his tracks, he referred to Cuba as “the island” and led a “normal life” disguised as a “right-wing person,” he said in one of the recordings. He also arrived at the meetings with the undercover agent in Miami deliberately straying from the most-direct route and pausing along the way in what prosecutors allege was classic, counter-surveillance “tradecraft” as taught by Cuba’s spymasters.“It’s what I’ve always been told to do,” Rocha told his handler about his movements.The case is part of a historically tense relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. Washington and Havana restored diplomatic relations in late 2014 after a half-century of Cold War acrimony, though the Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Cuba and, in 2021, redesignated it a state sponsor of terrorism.The charging document traces Rocha’s illegal ties to Cuba back to 1981, when he first joined the State Department, to well after his departure from the federal government, when he took on lucrative private sector jobs — most recently as a senior business adviser to an international public relations firm.The FBI learned about the relationship last year and arranged a series of undercover encounters in downtown Miami between Rocha and an agent purporting to be a Cuban intelligence operative.“I always told myself, ‘The only thing that can put everything we have done in danger is ... someone’s betrayal, someone who may have met me, someone who may have known something at some point,'” Rocha said in one of of the meetings, according to the charging document.In another meeting last year, Rocha referred to Cuba shooting down two unarmed planes sent by the Miami-based group of exiles Brothers to the Rescue in which four opponents of Castro’s government were killed in 1996.There’s no indication in the complaint that Rocha aided the Cubans with the military operation — a major flashpoint in more than a half-century of brinksmanship between the communist-ruled island and its right-wing opponents in Miami. But at the time he served as a senior political officer at the U.S. special interest section in Havana.“I lived through it, because I was in charge,” Rocha said. “That was a time of a lot of tension.”Rocha’s service to Cuba may have gone back earlier than the start of his U.S. diplomatic career.The complaint cites Rocha telling the undercover agent, who went by the name Miguel, that he first proved his loyalty in Chile in 1973 – the same year right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with U.S. backing, overthrew the socialist government of Salvador Allende.“They must have told you something because you mentioned Chile,” Rocha told the undercover agent who presented himself as having reached out to him at the request of higher-ups in Cuba’s National Intelligence Directorate. “That inspired trust in me.”Born in Colombia, Rocha was raised in a working-class home in New York City and went on to obtain a succession of liberal arts degrees from Yale, Harvard and Georgetown before joining the foreign service in 1981.He was the top U.S. diplomat in Argentina between 1997 and 2000 as a decade-long currency stabilization program backed by Washington was unraveling under the weight of huge foreign debt and stagnant growth, triggering a political crisis that would see the South American country cycle through five presidents in two weeks.At his next post, as ambassador to Bolivia, he intervened directly into the 2002 presidential race, warning weeks ahead of the vote that the U.S. would cut off assistance to the poor South American country if it were to elect former coca grower Evo Morales.“I want to remind the Bolivian electorate that if they vote for those who want Bolivia to return to exporting cocaine, that will seriously jeopardize any future aid to Bolivia from the United States,″ Rocha said in a speech that was widely interpreted as an attempt to sustain U.S. dominance in the region.The gambit angered Bolivians and gave Morales a last-minute boost. When he was finally elected three years later, the leftist leader expelled Rocha’s successor as chief of the diplomatic mission for inciting “civil war.”Rocha also served in Italy, Honduras, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, and worked as a Latin America expert for the National Security Council.After his retirement from the State Department, Rocha began a second career in business, serving as the president of a gold mine in the Dominican Republic partly owned by Canada’s Barrick Gold.More recently, he’s held senior roles at XCoal, a Pennsylvania-based coal exporter; Clover Leaf Capital, a company formed to facilitate mergers in the cannabis industry; law firm Foley & Lardner; and Spanish public relations firm Llorente & Cuenca, which said Monday that it had fired him.John Feeley, who ended a long diplomatic career serving as U.S. ambassador to Panama, said he was \"saddened and shocked that my former mentor turned out to be a career Cuban mole.\"Feeley, who retired from the State Department over differences with President Donald Trump's administration, said that the last time he saw Rocha he was surprised by how a diplomat who had served administrations of both parties had so fully embraced Trump’s brand of politics.“It is beyond ironic that he cultivated this cartoonish persona and that everyone apparently bought it,” he said.",

        "title_text": "How Authoritarian Regimes Go After Journalists Beyond Their Borders",
        "body_text": "Authoritarian campaigns to clamp down on dissent and control the media have driven scores of journalists from countries like Afghanistan, Belarus, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Nicaragua, and Russia into exile. But what is increasingly different today is that the repression of a free press does not stop at the border.Authoritarian governments are in unprecedented ways harassing, intimidating, and silencing independent voices far beyond their jurisdictions—a phenomenon known as “transnational repression.” Freedom House has identified 112 incidents against journalists from 2014 to 2023, spanning assault, detention, unlawful deportation, rendition, and even assassination. The shocking news of Saudi Arabia’s assassination and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 may come most to mind—but at least 25 other governments have targeted journalists abroad.Read More: The Long Arm of Transnational RepressionThis repression is linked to a global decline in democracy itself, as attacks on independent media continue to increase around the world.From their new homes in Europe and North America, over a dozen journalists interviewed by Freedom House revealed how transnational repression imperils their physical and psychological safety and makes their work that much more difficult. Russian journalist Galina Timchenko, who cofounded the Latvia-based online media outlet Meduza, takes onerous security precautions when traveling, knowing that other Russian journalists in Europe have been poisoned. Kiyya Baloch, a freelance journalist from the Balochistan region of Pakistan, was advised to get a safety alarm from law enforcement in Norway, where he sought refuge, after Pakistani authorities threatened him and placed him on an antiterrorism watchlist.The threat of being physically harmed, arrested, or kidnapped is only the tip of the iceberg. Journalists are frequently targeted online with death threats, smear campaigns, surveillance, and cyberattacks. Female journalists from Iran to China face vicious abuse, including rape threats and the dissemination of personal information. This digital peril has not only become a grueling fact of life for many journalists but has also become a professional obstacle: exiled journalists are undermined by these tactics as they seek to build credibility with audiences and communicate safely with their sources, limiting their ability to pursue sensitive stories and expand their reach.Many exiled journalists also worry about reprisals and harassment against relatives back home. In Xinjiang, the Muslim-majority northwest Chinese region, authorities have bullied critics into silence by threatening their families. Now working as a journalist for Radio Free Asia in the U.S., Gulchehra Hoja is one of several exiled Uyghurs whose families have been targeted in apparent retaliation for their reporting on Beijing’s human rights abuses. Over 20 of her relatives back home were harassed and arbitrarily detained by Chinese authorities, and some are believed to be held in internment camps.Read More: ‘Fear Follows Every Uyghur.’ A Groundbreaking Book Details China’s Repression in XinjiangWestern democracies, where most of these exiled journalists end up, owe a duty of care to them. Governments should consistently record incidents and perpetrators to raise awareness about the threat. For instance, the U.S. State Department should continue to strengthen its section on transnational repression in its annual country reports on human rights practices.Governments should also apply more international pressure, foremost among them the U.S., through sanctions and the use of diplomatic channels, to send a strong signal to repressive regimes that their cross-border attacks will not be tolerated in free societies. Some affected journalists—including Uyghur reporters in the U.S. whose relatives have been targeted in China—have appealed to diplomats to advocate for them in bilateral meetings. But they would benefit from more practical follow-up and public interventions on their behalf.Support for victims must also be bolstered. For the Farsi-language news channel Iran International, headquartered in London, intervention from British police was crucial in ensuring a safe return of the U.K. in September, months after they were forced to relocate staff to the U.S. in response to a spate of death threats from Tehran against their staff. Host countries’ resettlement programs should be robust and efficient, so that journalists forced into exile need not fear obstacles that threaten their legal status, including illegitimate criminal charges launched by the regimes they left behind.Finally, exiled journalists and the outlets they often continue to run, need enough resources to track and respond to physical and digital attacks and provide psychosocial support for affected colleagues. Donor networks are a lifeline for recently exiled journalists, and programs like the JX Fund—a transnational alliance of media, civil society, and funders—are instrumental in providing vital resources for journalists to carry on with their work.If autocrats are allowed to silence journalists with impunity, the link that connects the world to vital insights into some of the most authoritarian countries may be permanently severed. Governments, social media platforms, and civil society all have a stake in defending those that speak truth to power, because threats that follow journalists into exile are a threat to democracies worldwide.",

        "body_text": "ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok has struck an agreement to invest in a unit of Indonesia’s GoTo Group and cooperate on an online shopping service, pioneering a template for e-commerce beyond Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.The Chinese-owned video service has agreed broadly to work with GoTo’s Tokopedia across several areas rather than compete directly with the Indonesian platform, people familiar with the pact said. The pair aim to announce details of that tie-up as soon as next week, the people said, asking not to be identified disclosing a deal before it’s formalized. GoTo’s shares erased morning declines to climb as high as 5% in Jakarta. While the two companies have reached an informal agreement, the final details of that alliance are getting hammered out and could change before announcement, the people said. The pact is also subject to regulatory approval and could still fall through, they added.Read More: Nepal Bans TikTok and Tightens Control Over All Social Media PlatformsAn investment in Tokopedia will be a first of its kind for TikTok Shop, the rapidly growing arm of ByteDance’s video service that’s making inroads into online shopping from the U.S. to Europe. Its progress in Indonesia against Sea Ltd. and Tokopedia, however, came to a halt when Jakarta — responding to complaints from local merchants — forced TikTok to split payments from shopping in the country.Now, a tieup with a savvy local operator could provide a model for TikTok as it pursues expansion in other markets such as Malaysia, where the government has signaled a willingness to review the influence of overseas players like TikTok. Bloomberg News reported last month that TikTok and GoTo were discussing a potential investment but another option was a joint venture. That could entail building a new e-commerce platform. Representatives for TikTok and GoTo declined to comment.ByteDance’s ultimate goal is to revive its online-shopping service in Southeast Asia’s largest retail arena. TikTok, the only platform immediately affected by Jakarta’s new rules, has halted online shopping to comply with the curbs.Read More: How ByteDance Is Expanding Its Reach Beyond TikTok With CapCut—One of the Most Popular Apps in AmericaIndonesia is the first and largest market for TikTok Shop. It started the service in Indonesia in 2021 and its instant success with younger, video-first shoppers encouraged it to expand into other markets including the US.For GoTo, Indonesia’s largest internet company, a deal with TikTok could be risky as it would help a major online-retail rival to operate in the country. But it would also give GoTo a strong global social-media partner in an arrangement that could boost shopping, logistics and payments volumes for both companies.Chief Executive Officer Patrick Walujo, who took over in June, is trying to bring GoTo to profitability on an adjusted basis by the end of the year to show the ride-hailing and e-commerce company has long-term potential. The managing partner of shareholder Northstar Group is continuing his predecessors’ campaign to reduce losses by slashing jobs, cutting promotions and tightening expense controls.TikTok has been attempting to engage government officials and other social media companies to figure out a way to restart its e-commerce operations in the country. Indonesian minister Teten Masduki said TikTok has spoken with five companies including Tokopedia, PT Bukalapak.com and Blibli about possible partnerships.Read More: What to Know About the TikTok Security ConcernsIndonesia is among the first countries in Southeast Asia to push back against TikTok. Navigating the conflict will be pivotal for the company as governments across the world assess how Southeast Asia’s largest nation moves to curb the social media giant’s burgeoning e-commerce presence. TikTok said just months earlier it will invest billions of dollars into the region.Following the Indonesian restrictions, nearby Malaysia said it is studying the possibility of regulating TikTok and its e-commerce operations. The social media leader is already facing possible bans and scrutiny in the likes of the U.S., Europe and India on national security concerns.",

        "body_text": "Hundreds of Rohingya refugees in two boats arrived on the shores of Aceh province in northern Indonesia on Sunday, after spending weeks adrift at sea, only to be shunned by local residents concerned about the surge of Rohingya arrivals in recent months.When one of the boats carrying 135 refugees arrived on a beach in Aceh province’s Lamreh village, after being adrift for more than a month, local residents were hesitant to let them near their houses, instead driving the refugees in trucks to the governor’s office. Meanwhile, the other boat that had docked on Sunday, carrying 180 people who were stranded at sea for about 27 days, arrived in Blang Raya village, where residents had tried in vain to stop it from docking. In response to increasing numbers of refugees arriving in Indonesia—at least 1,400 since November, more than three-quarters of whom are women and children, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees—some 100 protestors in Aceh province called for the refugees to be relocated, even clashing with the police during the demonstration as they tried to force their way into a shelter where the Rohingya refugees were staying.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Friday that human trafficking is suspected to be behind the recent influx of Rohingya on Indonesia’s shores, and warned of “firm action” against the traffickers. He added that while authorities would provide temporary humanitarian aid to the Rohingya, they would prioritize local residents.Another boat that sailed from Bangladesh around the same time remains missing, according to the Associated Press. The UNHCR said in a statement to TIME on Monday that it “does not at present have confirmed information on additional boats which may be at sea.”“UNHCR commends the life-saving actions taken by the Indonesian authorities and Acehnese people to rescue and safely disembark persons distressed at sea,” the agency said, adding that “continued solidarity, humanity and regional cooperation is needed to avoid tragedy and loss of life.”The UNHCR said in a press release in early December that it had received reports of two overcrowded boats “aimlessly drifting” in the Andaman Sea and called for “urgent action” by governments in the region to locate and rescue the stranded passengers. It’s unclear if the boats that docked on Sunday are the ones mentioned in that UNHCR press release. When asked by TIME, the U.N. agency said that it does not currently have enough information to cross-reference the boats. “UNHCR is concerned that food and water may be running out and there is a significant risk of fatalities in the coming days if people are not rescued and disembarked to safety,” the early December press release said. “In line with the principle of non-refoulement,  international obligations under the Laws of the Sea and longstanding maritime traditions, the duty to rescue persons in distress at sea must be upheld, irrespective of nationality or legal status of the persons in need of rescue.”One of the boats was ascertained to have engine failure, UNHCR spokesperson Babar Baloch told TIME at the time. “We are worried that the world may witness another tragedy with hundreds of desperate Rohingya losing their lives without timely efforts to save them,” he said.The captain of one of the boats told the AP that his boat had run out of food and water and he feared the 180 to 190 people aboard would all die. He also said on Sunday that the boat was about 200 miles from Thailand’s west coast—though a Royal Thai Navy spokesperson told the AP on Monday that they did not have information on the boats.The head of a fishermen’s association in Aceh, an Indonesian province that’s a common destination for Rohingya refugees at sea, told the New York Times that they were aware of the two missing boats but had yet to hear of rescue plans.The Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, have been systematically discriminated against by authorities for decades, and hundreds of thousands fled amid renewed persecution in 2017. Around one million Rohingya are now housed in the world’s largest refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, where they live in squalid and overcrowded shelters. Amid worsening conditions in the camp, an increasing number have been fleeing Bangladesh through perilous journeys by sea, in the hopes of starting new lives in Malaysia, Indonesia, or Thailand.Over 3,400 Rohingya refugees—most of whom are women and children—have embarked on sea journeys since January 2023, and 225 of them have been reported dead or missing, according to the UNHCR. The agency also counted more than 3,500 Rohingya who made sea journeys throughout 2022, up 360% from the year before. At least 348 died or went missing last year, making it the deadliest year since 2014.Even those who do survive the long journey to foreign shores, however, aren’t typically welcomed or guaranteed safety when they arrive. Boats with Rohingya refugees are often turned away by local communities or authorities, despite calls from international organizations for the refugees to be accepted. Just last month, about 250 Rohingya who had spent weeks sailing from Bangladesh before arriving off the coast of Aceh province were sent back to sea by locals.Advocates have warned that inaction from regional governments can spell deadly consequences for the hundreds of Rohingya currently adrift in the Andaman Sea: last December, after being stranded for weeks, a boat’s 180 passengers were eventually presumed drowned.",

        "title_text": "Putin to Visit Saudi Arabia, UAE for Israel-Hamas War Talks. Here’s What to Know",
        "body_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin will be making a one-day trip to Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Wednesday to discuss the Israel-Hamas war, the Kremlin said. Later in the week, Putin will host his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, in Moscow. Putin has sought to increase Russia’s influence in the Middle East, and experts say he is emboldened by growing international criticism of Israel amid its bombardment of Gaza, which has left at least 15,500 people dead. \"Russia does not have the same loyalties as the U.S. does with Israel, which allows it to express sympathy for both Israel and Palestine in ways many Western countries, not least America, struggle to,” wrote James Nixey and Nikolay Kozhanov for Chatham House. In the past, Russia has tried to maintain positive relations with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. But Putin has taken a different approach in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people in Israel. He waited three days before commenting on the attack, then blamed Washington. \"I think that many will agree with me that this is a clear example of the failed policy in the Middle East of the United States, which tried to monopolize the settlement process,\" Putin told Iraq's Prime Minister.Putin subsequently invited a Hamas delegation—the militant group is backed by Russian ally Tehran—to Moscow on Oct. 26, which prompted anger from Israeli officials.“Israel's main ally is the United States, Russia's main enemy right now. And Hamas' ally is Iran, an ally of Russia,\" Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, wrote in his blog, according to Reuters. The meetings are also expected to discuss oil prices. Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are all members of OPEC+, a group of oil producing countries. Last week, members of OPEC+ voluntarily agreed to cut their output, to help drive up prices. Putin will first land in the UAE before stopping in Saudi Arabia for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader. \"I hope that these will be very useful negotiations, which we consider extremely important,\" Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian media.In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Putin has rarely traveled abroad. The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest in March 2023 over the forced deportation of Ukranian children to Russia. His last trip outside the borders of the former Soviet Union was to China in October.Putin declined to attend a BRICS summit in South Africa in August because the country would be obliged to arrest him in light of the ICC arrest warrant.",

        "title_text": "Sudan’s Dangerous Descent Into Warlordism",
        "body_text": "Like millions of people from Sudan, we have seen our families suffer in the wake of a devastating war that began in April. No one in Sudan has been spared. Both of us are lucky to have escaped with our lives but we have relatives who were killed in the fighting, kidnapped at gunpoint, and whose homes were destroyed. We receive WhatsApp messages from family members who are internally displaced, stuck at the borders or, for those able to leave Sudan, living precarious lives in neighboring countries without rights or legal status. For the past nine months, the vicious war being fought in our country has been far from the attention of a distracted world. Well before the current Israel-Hamas war came to dominate headlines, the conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was a mere footnote on the international agenda. And yet Sudan stands on the edge of an abyss. Rival bids for power between Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the SAF leader, and RSF counterpart Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, underpins the war. Sudan had been run by a council of generals, including these two erstwhile allies, after a 2021 coup brought an end to civilian rule in the wake of the 2019 pro-democracy movement that deposed longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Tensions came to a head on April 15 when fighting broke out in our home city of Khartoum, and it quickly spread to other regions of the country. Some 10,000 people have since been killed, almost certainly a vast undercount. With at least 6 million people already driven from their homes, Sudan has the world’s largest displaced population, and the number is growing by the day as fighting intensifies. In Darfur in particular, the situation is alarming. The RSF—which evolved from the Janjaweed militia that earned worldwide infamy during the Darfur crisis of two decades ago—has conducted a brutal campaign that is on the verge of securing full control of the region. Rampaging across Darfur on motorcycles, horses, or pick-up trucks, the RSF and allied Arab militias have been accused of ethnically motivated killings against the Massalit and other non-Arab communities; indiscriminate and deliberate attacks against civilians; and widespread sexual violence and rape. (The U.S. government recently determined that both the SAF and RSF have committed war crimes, and that the RSF has committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.) In early November, the RSF and its allies reportedly killed at least 800 people in an attack on just one town—Ardamata in West Darfur province. A senior U.N. official in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, wasn’t exaggerating when she said, “What is happening is verging on pure evil.” A group of U.N. experts called “on both parties to the conflict to end violations of humanitarian and human rights law,” but they expressed “specific concern” with the RSF’s “brutal and widespread use of rape and other forms of sexual violence.” Sudan is a large country, strategically located, and its speedy disintegration is already having spillover effects throughout the Horn of Africa, Sahel, and Red Sea regions. Major refugee flows into neighboring countries such as Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia are ongoing, while the fighting in Darfur is causing fallout across the border in Chad. Peace talks that concluded last month in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia—convened by the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and a bloc of East African nations—might have seemed like a positive step toward peace. But it has mostly provided the warring parties with cover for further violence as the U.N. remains gridlocked. The Security Council has not passed a substantive resolution on Sudan since the war began.Meanwhile, regional powers have picked sides. Egypt, Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia support the SAF while the UAE, a U.N. Security Council member, backs the RSF in seeming violation of the body’s own arms embargo on Darfur, first enacted in 2004 and just renewed (with a yes vote from the UAE) in March 2023. (The UAE has denied supplying weapons or ammunition to the RSF.)In the wake of last month’s failed peace talks in Jeddah, the international community needs to step in and prioritize genuine peace talks, a durable ceasefire, increased humanitarian access, and a surge of resources for aid and protection efforts. The U.N.’s Sudan response plan requires $2.6 billion; it is about a third funded. We, like so many Sudanese, have been forced to flee our country, leaving behind the land and people that we love. The Khartoum that we called home and know is gone. Bodies are piling up in the streets, in some cases eaten by stray dogs. Those who are too sick or weak to move await death as heavy shelling surrounds them.But our nation is worth saving. There are everyday Sudanese at the forefront of the humanitarian response working to keep communities safe and weaving back the social fabric that this war has torn asunder. We, and they, need the world to join the struggle to end this war before it is too late.  ",

        "body_text": "It was easy to miss, amid the horrors, what answered them. In the blood-soaked weeks that started on Oct. 7, the most consequential acts in Israel and in Gaza may also have been the least noticed, carried out not by those who claimed leadership but by those whom leaders had failed. The people who pulled others out of rubble, or out of hiding, who sheltered strangers, who bent to heal wounds seen and unseen, they all answered unspeakable violence with a shared humanity. But their selflessness did more than save lives. It illuminated the connection at the heart of a contest that has preoccupied the world for most of a century, the fellow feeling that defines a community and, more broadly, a nation. Amid the negation of war, and in the absence of a state, two nations were affirmed. In Israel, the absence was temporary but catastrophic. As Hamas terrorists marauded across the country’s south, killing 1,200 people in a day and retreating back to Gaza with hundreds of hostages, the Israeli government was simply not in evidence. Into the void surged the people of Israel. Within hours, a matrix of volunteers mobilized to rescue those stranded in safe rooms, sustain those evacuated from border areas, and address the traumas of survivors.The effort was instant, intuitive, unrequested. Its leaders were citizens who had spent the prior 10 months organizing weekly protests against an extremist government angling to erase the only check on its power. Pivoting from protest to service, the loose network of citizens dispatched trauma kits and therapists. When it emerged that no one, least of all the authorities, knew who was dead, who was alive, and who had been abducted, computer experts by the hundreds dove into a digital netherworld, sleuthing for clues.And just as Hamas made no distinction among the people it slaughtered and stole—Jews, Bedouins, the Palestinian citizens once known as Israeli Arabs, Thai guest workers hired to toil in fields—all of Israeli society reached out. A citizenry riven by inequity and political crisis assembled in the collective spirit that defined Israel at its founding. “We see this as a restatement of the country,” said Gigi Levy-Weiss, a tech entrepreneur who helped organize the response at the Tel Aviv convention center, where as many as 15,000 people showed up with strollers, paper towels—everything, really. “There is a new core.”In the Gaza Strip, the government stayed gone. Palestinians have no state, but in the Strip the Islamic Resistance Movement, better known as Hamas, has held power for the past 16 years. After the Israeli military began its retaliatory strikes, however, the group’s political apparatus proved as elusive as its armed wing. “There is no police station, there are no municipalities ... There’s almost nothing,” says Amir Hasanain, a 21-year-old student in Rafah who, like uncounted others, responded by assuming the duties of wartime public servant. Organizing themselves into what he describes as “a simulation of government,” the volunteers delivered basic goods to sustain a civilian population suffering bombardment and homelessness. In the first eight weeks of the assault, nearly 16,000 of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Some 1.9 million were forced to flee their homes, the United Nations reported.The uprooting evoked what Palestinians call the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” that transformed a narrow enclave beside the Mediterranean into one of the world’s most densely populated places, its numbers swollen by refugees from villages lost to Jewish forces in the 1948 war that created Israel. Defending itself in the decades that followed, Israel would occupy and then settle both Gaza and the West Bank (leaving Gaza in 2005). In those same decades, the Palestinian identity took root. Claimed by some 14 million people globally, it is grounded not only in geography and shared experience but also in the aspiration to what the U.N. Charter declares the right of any people: a state of their own.“What is so inspiring is the communalism,” says Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British Palestinian physician who hastens from his London practice to Gaza whenever there is a war. If the destruction and death of this one is unprecedented, he says, so is the selflessness. “Everything is being shared,” he says, “and that’s what is keeping society from collapsing. Nobody turns anyone away.”As entire neighborhoods were flattened by bombs, whole new cities sprang up beneath tarps and blankets. Rida Thabet was the principal at a 500-student vocational college, the Khan Younis Training Centre, built and run by the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). But on Oct. 13, the day the Israeli military ordered the Strip’s northern half emptied, Thabet effectively became a mayor, 40,000 people having crammed into the school grounds. “It’s like a city,” she says.Thirty babies had been born there by late November. Women who gave birth during daylight hours could find help at the shelter’s three medical posts. At night, Thabet recruits volunteer medics from the tents. Mohammed Bardaweel spent most of his career in emergency rooms but now does what he can with a kit from the World Health Organization. The hardest cases arrive from the north. One woman came by foot a day after a cesarean section. Another arrived with a 6-year-old with sepsis from a wound caused by phosphorus munitions, he says. “I hope that the nations all around the world who believe in peace and human rights will try to end this war,” the physician says. He pauses before adding, “I know that nations are different than governments.” By the evidence at hand in both Israel and Gaza, it’s a distinction that might inspire hope. —With reporting by -Leslie Dickstein/New York •It turns out that just as in a murder investigation, the first 48 hours are also crucial in the treatment of emotional trauma. Merav Roth pointed this out in a video call to fellow mental-health professionals the day after the Hamas massacre. “The psyche asks, Am I supposed to collapse?” she recalls. “Is there anything to hold onto? And if you come immediately with an answer, saying, ‘Hold my hand,’ you can bring the life instinct into service, and begin to put yourself together again.”Therapists now double as first responders in Israel. Ofrit Shapira-Berman runs a WhatsApp group that within three minutes, and sometimes 50 seconds, matches a psychoanalyst with a trauma survivor, drawing from a list of almost 500 volunteers. Many provide a lifetime of analysis at no charge. “When someone loses someone that he loves, he sort of moves to another continent; there is a continent of bereaved people,” Shapira-Berman says. “This is not a continent. It’s a planet.” At a lushly bucolic event center north of Tel Aviv, survivors of the Nova music festival, where more than 350 were killed, gather each afternoon and evening for what looks like a lawn party. “There’s so much science on how nature heals,” says Lia Naor, who created the retreat. Survivors steer their therapy by answering the question, What do you feel like doing? There’s music, beanbag chairs to hang out in, a sound bath. There are therapists too. “But they’re not on you,” says Liam Kedem, 24, who ran six miles from Hamas gunmen and comes to the retreat every day. “What makes me really feel like recovering is just sitting with the friends that I’ve been in the situation with. In the city, people look at me with these sad eyes.”The approach, which seems perfectly suited to people who would attend a rave, can be adapted to meet anyone where they live. “We’re 9 million people in trauma. It’s not one or two,” Naor says. “So the only way to treat is within community.”The Hamas massacre also activated the 2,000-year communal history of persecution every Jew carries. “We are so trained in trauma,” says Roth, a psychoanalyst and professor at the University of Haifa. “I was raised into the Holocaust.” But if Holocaust survivors were shunned in Israel in the 1950s as damaged or weak, subsequent generations have learned to appreciate the experience of victims and make common cause with their grief.At the Dead Sea hotel where survivors of the Be’eri kibbutz are lodged, Roth met a woman of 85, who “was black with her death wish. She said, ‘I don’t want to live in such a world.’ And I said, ‘Please look around you for a second. Is this the world you want to leave?’” The sprawling resort was jammed with all manner of goods donated from around the country. “Her eyes filled with tears, but loving tears. And she said, ‘It’s so amazing. From the first moment, people came, and came with everything that we need.’”“Solidarity,” Roth says, “is a cure.”At the shelters where most of Gaza’s residents now reside, there are shortages of almost everything except people. But that can be a blessing, as they bring expertise. When Lana Okal arrived at the Khan Younis Training Centre camp she announced that she was a doctor. The 25-year-old had graduated in January from Cairo University’s Kasr Al-Ainy School of Medicine, an experience she savored after life in Gaza. Her hope was to study in Britain after completing a year interning at Gaza City’s Al-Shifa medical center. She had two months left when the war began. “We had yet to cover anesthesiology and emergency medicine,” Okal says.She was put to work. By day, she has helped record the health status of the displaced people in the shelter. At night, she is on the list of medics who have volunteered to be roused in emergencies. Trained in primary care, Okal felt useful treating most of the patients brought to her. But one night in late November, she found herself facing a 40-year-old woman who had been pushed in a wheelchair from Gaza City with her children. Her leg had been amputated after being crushed in the bombing; her husband was dead; and the young physician felt as overwhelmed as the Gaza health care system itself. “She said, ‘Help me.’ I cannot. I want to try, but I cannot.” The amputation was “very polluted,” Okal says, and she had neither the equipment nor the expertise to treat it. Cell networks were down, so no ambulance could be summoned. “The situation here,” Okal says, “is very difficult.”Before there was Tel Aviv, there was Jaffa, an ancient city with the cosmopolitan feel of a Mediterranean port and a population to match: a third of the city are Palestinian citizens of Israel. That might explain Amir Badran’s presence on the Tel Aviv–Jaffa city council. But only faith in human nature could account for his decision this fall to run for mayor just two years after Israel’s “mixed cities” erupted in street fights.Watching the news on Oct. 7, Badran knew his campaign was in trouble. But he held out hope for Jaffa. With a few phone calls, the attorney founded the Guard for Jewish-Arab Partnership, a joint effort to keep the peace. It advertises and staffs a hotline, sends volunteers to escort people who feel unsafe, and partners with Standing Together, a nationwide solidarity effort. Fear is all around. In the month after the massacre, as many Israelis applied for gun permits (236,000) as had done so in the previous 20 years. Jaffa Arabs like Badran who were appalled by the Hamas massacre were also shaken by Israel’s retaliation. Some 200,000 residents of Gaza trace their families to Jaffa, the home they fled or were expelled from in 1948.“We will work together, Arab and Jewish residents, to keep each other’s backs,” Badran says, “to be safe in our homes, to secure our mosques, synagogues and churches, and to show the world that we can do it differently, while other people speak in the language of war, especially the mixed cities.” Regaining that equilibrium, he says, is the only way forward for a country where 20% descend from Palestinians who stayed within Israel’s borders in 1948. “The reality is that we are living together, and we will have to still live together.”For most people in Gaza, the war is a saga of exodus into smaller and smaller spaces. More than 1.6 million of its 2.3 million residents have been forced from their homes, first into the southern half of the Strip, then into the cramped lots where 1.4 million have sought refuge under the blue flag of the U.N. Some 40,000 are camped in the vocational college run by Rida Thabet.Their hardship is more than a humanitarian challenge for Thabet; it is a personal one. “I’m displaced myself,” she says. She hails from Gaza City, from which people still arrive, sometimes wounded, always stressed. “They see us as management,” Thabet says. “They come with anger, and they throw that anger on your face.” The face is sympathetic. Thabet comforts not only her 15-year-old daughter, traumatized by the cascades of bombing, but also her guests. On Nov. 24 the oldest was the 95-year-old woman who asked, as she does daily,  “Where am I? Who are you?” The youngest was just hours old.“You want to help but you feel helpless,” says Thabet. Her answer is action: finding mattresses for those at risk of bedsores, tarpaulins for people sleeping in the open, common ground for feuding spouses, and support groups for children who have seen too much. As an employee of UNRWA, which in peacetime provides schools, medical services, and aid to the 74% of Gazans who are registered refugees, Thabet is both an anchor of Gaza’s middle class, and a conduit for the trickle of assistance reaching them. More than 100 of her colleagues have been killed, including a friend who died “giving training on how to keep safe.” “We have some unique stories,” Thabet says. “Some of them are very sad ones. And some can give hope.”Few societies are built around the military the way Israel is. So it made sense that the largest protests against Benjamin Netanyahu’s efforts to sideline the judiciary earlier this year were led by a group called Brothers and Sisters in Arms. Started by seven military reservists on WhatsApp, it grew to 50,000 members, many of whom vowed not to serve in protest of the Prime Minister’s power grab.When Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, the group nonetheless urged its members to report for duty “without hesitation.” But the real surprise was that it stepped in for a government that proved unable to function. Brothers and Sisters for Israel, as it was renamed that same day, posted an emergency button on leading news sites: “If you have an emergency, click here.” It sent 400 teams to the communities around Gaza to coax terrified residents out of safe rooms, and 5,000 volunteers to work the depopulated farms. Hospitals got help treating the wounded, evacuees got hot meals, and donations got sorted in an underground parking garage staffed each day by 10,000 to 15,000 volunteers. The Facebook post “Can we just pay taxes directly to Brothers and Sisters in Arms?” became a meme. “You see the power of unity,” says Ron Scherf, a co-founder. “Everybody’s now focusing on helping each other.”Three weeks after the massacre, the situation room at the Tel Aviv convention center was still humming. A computer whiteboard listed 60 teams, ranging from intelligence to kindergartens, other protest groups having pivoted just as nimbly to whatever needed doing. (A lawyer previously tasked with springing arrested protesters had organized the retrieval of pets from evacuated towns.) Information scholar Karine Nahon led the effort to sort the dead from the abducted, a daunting task that began with 14,500 names. Some 500 volunteers crawled through social media feeds and 150 Hamas Telegram channels, deploying facial-recognition software and novel algorithms. “We’re a small country,” Nahon says. “We gave a call, and everybody showed up.”Eyal Shai, an air force reservist with experience running giant call centers, organized the teams. “They’re talking in systems,” he says. “I’m talking people and jobs.” Every hour, a table of volunteers would break to talk with a psychologist. Few knew each other by name, but many recognized each other from the protests that, at the time, had felt like the most important task at hand. “When you look at the motive for our behavior over the last year, it all came from being patriotic,” says Oren Shvill, another of the founders. “True love of country.”The future of any society relies on the likes of Amir Hasanain. The résumé of the 21-year-old student is a ladder of civil-society internships and academic scholarships capped by a semester at Missouri State University, sponsored by the U.S. State Department. Hasanain was back in Gaza doing his final undergrad year when Israeli bombs flattened Al-Azhar University. “I have witnessed a lot of things,” Hasanain says. Many are horrible, like “the scream of my little brothers and sisters every time there is an airstrike.” In the first days of the bombardment, the entire family gathered in one room so “we all die at once, and none has to regret his survival.” But he has also witnessed the owners of private wells opening them to all. Those with solar panels charge phones for free. Police stations are not operating, but “elderly people in the neighborhood volunteer to solve the quarrels that arise between neighbors,” he says. “The government is now dysfunctional,” he notes, but the people have stepped up.Hasanain himself rises at 6 a.m. at his home in Rafah, near the Egyptian border, and walks first to the market and back, then two kilometers to wait four hours for water. He rides a donkey cart to where he volunteers delivering food or other aid via the civil-society organizations that are like the passersby who, in the absence of civil-defense workers, scramble into the rubble in search of survivors. Walking two kilometers home, Hasanain eats his one meal of the day. After two months of war, though, the real concern is mental stamina, he says. “The days are just overlapping with more fear, disappointment, and frustration.”",

        "title_text": "‘The Best Way to Preserve Peace Is to Be Able to Fight a War’: Taiwan’s Foreign Minister on Resisting Chinese Aggression",
        "body_text": "The lobby of Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry contains just 13 flags—one for each of the self-ruling island’s diplomatic allies. Since 1990, the building’s janitors have hauled away 15 more belonging to nations that have been persuaded to jettison Taipei and instead recognize Beijing, as the world’s No. 2 economy flexes its geopolitical muscle to isolate what it considers its renegade province.Taiwan effectively split from the mainland following the routed Nationalists’ flight across the strait in 1949 after China’s civil war. The Chinese Communist Party has never governed Taiwan—it was only sparsely inhabited by the Qing Dynasty and was ruled by Japan from 1895 until 1945—though it still claims the island of 23 million as its sovereign territory.Chinese President Xi Jinping has made clear his intention to bring Taiwan back into the fold, responding to any direct contact it has with other nations with economic sanctions, military drills, and a diplomatic freeze. “China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable,” Xi told President Joe Biden in San Francisco last month.It’s pressure that doesn’t make life easy for Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu. But even if the flags downstairs are dwindling, a fresh one has been installed in his office, where a blue and yellow Ukrainian banner signed by frontline soldiers flutters on permanent display. Nearby are a pair of boxing gloves signed by Vitali Klitschko, Ukraine’s former world heavyweight boxing champion and current mayor of Kyiv, in thanks for Taiwan’s support following Russia’s invasion.In an interview with TIME, Wu explains how the Ukraine war has galvanized democracies to resist authoritarianism and support Taiwan in the face of mounting Chinese aggression. And as Taiwan approaches elections early next month, Wu says his government is working hard to forge trade and informal links with myriad nations to render the cost of any conflict prohibitively high. “No country, no matter how big and powerful it is, has any right to initiate any aggression against another country, whether it is in Europe or in the Indo-Pacific,” Wu says.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.China’s trying to reduce our international space, including our diplomatic allies and our participation in international organizations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been fighting very hard on all this. But at the same time, Taiwan is getting more support from like-minded countries.Our relations with major democracies—the United States, Japan, Australia, U.K., Canada, France, etc.—have improved tremendously in the last few years. And we are also trying to cultivate new friendships, especially Central and Eastern European countries. Most of the people in this part of the world still remember what it was like under a communist rule, so when they see that Taiwan is suffering from heavy pressure, especially military pressure, from communist China, they have a natural tendency of showing support.They also see that Taiwan’s economy can link up with their economy. And they’re also more open to Taiwanese visitors or new ideas on how to improve relations with Taiwan. So in the last few years, our relations with Central and Eastern European countries have also been improving tremendously. We would like to expand our cooperation and friendship with any country, any democracy, that is willing to be friends.Collective action is difficult because most of those countries that are coerced by China economically do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. And Taiwan is also not a member of any major economic or political organizations. But we are very happy to see that this topic has been picked up by various countries; the E.U. parliament has already adopted a resolution against economic coercion. And at the G7 Summit in May in Hiroshima, economic coercion was also a topic.What we have been able to do is to use our economic strengths to work with individual countries. So when Lithuania was suffering from the Chinese economic pressure, we’d discuss with them what we can do to reduce their economic pain. In this part of the world, China’s economic sanctions against Australia were a big matter. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not stopped serving Australian red wine since day one of Chinese economic sanctions.It is very important. It is the most comprehensive trade package agreed with any government that has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan. U.S. economic power is going to benefit Taiwan's economy, and that is also an example to many other countries who want to enhance trade ties with Taiwan.Canada just concluded negotiations with Taiwan on a foreign investment protection agreement—and it shows the goodwill coming from Canada to negotiate with Taiwan for better economic ties. The U.K. just announced an Enhanced Trade Partnership with Taiwan. So this is quite significant. I think the United States agreement to negotiate with Taiwan for 21st Century Trade is a very important milestone in encouraging other countries to follow suit.When the war started, the reaction from Taiwan was very strong. We issued a condemnation against Russia and joined sanctions as well. The reaction from regular people here is unbelievable. They’re very passionate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs set up an account to collect money donations, and within one month we collected almost $40 million. Some people here in Taiwan also want to donate materials—baby formula, clothing, diapers—and within one month we collected 600 tons of material.We realized that the determination to defend one’s country, by the regular people, is very important. We want to be equipped with the same kind of determination. The second is asymmetric warfare: decentralized individual units—mobile, nimble, carrying personal weapons—are able to hold a large military at bay. So we try to restructure and reform our military so they are more capable of fighting asymmetric warfare. The third thing that we have learned is international support. And it’s not just coming from Europe; it’s also from North America, from the Indo-Pacific. So with that lesson we also tried to speak with various countries to solicit their support.The result is pretty good from the major democracies around the world. They oppose any unilateral change of the status quo. And many of them also think that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is a matter of global prosperity and security; 50% of the world’s goods flow through the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan produces about 90% of semiconductor chips. Therefore, if Taiwan is affected, or if the supply chain is affected, the rest of the world is going to be affected.And with that kind of awareness, support coming from international organizations has been increasing. But Taiwan still needs to make contributions to the international community. So we’re still helping Ukraine, we’re still working together with countries like Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, to provide humanitarian assistance or to help the rebuilding process. We want to be seen by the international community as a force for good.On the one hand, our economy is still running very well, as opposed to other countries suffering from COVID, the aftermath of the Ukraine war, inflation, and all that. So Taiwan is resilient. Another thing is that we need to spend money in the right place; rather than buying big platforms, we need to make investments in military reform and training, we need to acquire those asymmetric types of weapons and train our soldiers to adapt to modern warfare.Fortunately, we have been supported by the United States in this regard. The U.S. has been trying to find creative ways to provide necessary defense articles for Taiwan. And they also help train our soldiers, so they are more capable of fighting modern warfare. The best way to preserve peace is to be able to fight a war. And if unfortunately a war is to take place, we will be able to defend ourselves.That is something we are concerned about, and we’ve been watching very carefully. We need to be concerned, not just from the defense perspective, but also from an economic perspective; we still trade with China, there’s still a lot of Taiwanese investors staying in China. So if China’s economy is slowing down, it’s going to affect Taiwan, like it affects the rest of the world.At the time when the Chinese economy is slowing down, what they need is to attract foreign investment. But some government agencies, like the [Ministry of State Security], may not be doing the right thing, or they are not coordinating with other government agencies; they adopted the anti-espionage law, they prevent foreign corporations from doing market surveys, [impose] tax inspections, some businesspeople are detained. All these things are telling international investors that they might not be welcome. So the national security people are doing things contrary to what the economy needs.And as long as the economy is in trouble, China’s foreign behavior needs careful observation. The Chinese government might have a temptation to divert domestic attention or to keep the country together by initiating a crisis outside. But so far, we don’t see the Chinese are preparing for that. We don’t see that war is imminent.",

        "title_text": "Dublin Riots Expose Irish Frustration at Housing, Cost-of-Living Crisis",
        "body_text": "On a chilly Thursday night in Dublin last month, the government and police were caught entirely off guard when violent riots broke out hours after a stabbing attack near a busy transit route in the city.The riots had an anti-immigration tone — the word “out” smeared on the back of a bus that was set alight and anti-immigrant chants shouted by rioters. Yet up to then, Ireland — with its stable and open economy and almost full employment — had managed to avoid the development of a large far-right movement, unlike many other European countries.Read More: How the Far-Right Won the Dutch Election—and What Comes Next for the NetherlandsThe riot was spurred in part by disinformation and online rumors about a possible foreign attack, despite the lack of any proof. But the agitators harnessed a deeper set of grievances among young people, struggling with spiraling prices and a desperate lack of affordable housing.For the Irish government, the shock waves are still reverberating. Justice Minister Minister Helen McEntee survived a no-confidence vote Tuesday evening as debate about the response and underlying causes swirled. Eighty-three lawmakers voted in support of McEntee, three more than needed for a majority. Opposition lawmakers have been critical of the police response and some pointed to deeper societal issues.“You cannot pepper spray alienation, you cannot baton charge anger at social inequality,” Mick Barry, a lawmaker from the opposition People Before Profit-Solidarity party, said during the parliament debate. “You cannot taser the housing crisis or use water cannons to wash away a culture of toxic masculinity.”Even as anti-immigration forces were widely blamed for the violence, the far right “tapped into a younger male cohort and tapped into the existing disaffection there,” said Kevin Cunningham, a politics lecturer at TU Dublin and founder of Ireland Thinks, which carries out statistical polling. Housing and the cost of living are the top issues Cunningham said he has found in polling. “There is a significant housing crisis in Ireland,” he added. A shortage of housing has translated into rapidly rising prices both in the rental and sale markets in Ireland. It was only earlier this year that the impact of higher interest rates and cost-of-living pressures led to prices falling for the first time in almost three years in Dublin, according to the statistics agency.Earlier this year, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar estimated Ireland has a shortage of 250,000 rental properties. A report last month estimated that the average rent for a new tenancy had risen by 18% above existing contracts, and the government has pledged to build an average of 33,000 new homes each year from 2021 to 2030. However, with increased numbers of refugees and asylum seekers, that plan may no longer be sufficient. “A lot of the stuff around immigration boils down to housing,” said Lorcan Sirr, a housing policy analyst, adding that those who took part in the riots were opportunistic. “We nenoed people to work, we need those people. But it is where are they going to live is the argument being used by the far right,” he said.The government has pledged to address the challenges behind the riots. Speaking in the parliament on Tuesday evening, deputy prime minister Micheal Martin said the violence “cannot be tolerated in our democratic republic. It represents a challenge to all of us here to show that we have a politics which is capable of treating serious issues with urgency and with a focus on action.” However, Sirr said a poor housing policy “has been used, or is being used, by the far right as a reason for not welcoming in people who we’re either morally or legally obligated to accept into the country.”Social housing is the sector that is the worst hit and while the government reached the target of new builds last year, the target for social housing was not met. The focus of policy has been the rental sector, Sirr said, with “institutional investors who get favorable tax treatments on the rents.”The housing of refugees and asylum seekers isn’t impacting the housing sector, said Cunningham, noting most are being housed in hotels. Even in 2016, when immigration “was the number one issue in most European countries, housing has been the most important issue for voters. It is still the most important issues for voters today.”",

        "title_text": "Key Moments From Former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s COVID-19 Inquiry Evidence",
        "body_text": "The U.K’s COVID-19 Inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic picked up again on Wednesday morning. The hearings for the initial stage of the investigation were heard in London in June. Today, former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who served as the nation’s leader from 2019 to 2022, was sworn in to give evidence in front of the panel. Shortly into his opening statement, he said that he was sorry for the suffering experienced by COVID victims and their families. “I understand the feelings of these victims and their families, and I am deeply sorry for the pain, and the loss, and the suffering of those victims and their families,\" Johnson said. \"And grateful though I am to the hundreds and thousands of healthcare workers... who helped to protect our country throughout the dreadful pandemic, I do hope that this inquiry will help to get the answers to the very difficult questions that those victims and those families are rightly asking...  so that we can protect ourselves better in the future and prevent further suffering.\"The U.K. has had 325 COVID deaths per 100,000 citizens, one of the highest death rates in Western Europe, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.The inquiry was created to help examine the government’s response to the pandemic and identify potential lessons for the future. The panel will not bestow criminal blame on those involved in the decision making process. Among those in attendance are bereaved families, who lost loved ones during the pandemic. “Boris Johnson is expected to issue an apology this morning. Yet, he will claim he saved thousands of lives. For many of the bereaved, that will be a grotesque distortion of the truth,” said a spokesperson for the bereaved families ahead of Johnson’s opening statement on Wednesday. Some believe that Johnson's initial hesitancy to implement lockdowns was to blame for the U.K.’s high death rate. In a press conference on March 12, 2023, when the nation had hundreds of confirmed cases, Johnson's government gave only soft guidelines, saying that people over the age of 70 and immunocompromised individuals should avoid going on cruises and recommending that school children did not travel overseas. The U.K. did not legally enforce lockdown measures until March 26, 2020. Previous questioning from the inquiry has put forward the claim that Johnson believed that the pandemic was \"nature's way of dealing with old people.\"Nevertheless, Johnson’s supporters have pointed out that the U.K. had one of the earliest vaccine rollouts in the world, and was the first nation to deploy an approved vaccine for the virus. “Inevitably we got some things wrong. But I think we were doing our best at the time,” Johnson said at the inquiry.The atmosphere in the hearing room has been tense. At one point, members from the bereaved families stood up, each holding a paper with a single word. Together, they formed the sentence: “The dead can’t hear your apologies.” According to a BBC journalist present at the inquiry, later on when the panel paused for a break, a protester shouted at Johnson: \"You’re a murderer.\"Hugo Keith, the lawyer responsible for questioning Johnson today, suggested that based on technical reports he had received, it seemed possible a factory reset had been carried out on  Johnson’s phone, leaving an estimated 5,000 WhatsApp messages missing that were supposed to be investigated by the inquiry. Johnson denied doing such a thing. “I haven’t removed any WhatsApps from my phone and I’ve given you everything that I think you need,” said Johnson. Johnson’s voice quivered during the hearing,  causing speculation that he was on the verge of tears. This came after he was asked to what extent his decision making was influenced by fear of imposing interventions too early and causing behavioral fatigue in the population. “We have to be realistic about 2020. That whole year. That whole tragic, tragic year,” he said before pausing as his voice seemed to break. “We did lock down. But then it bounced back.” Keith came down hard on Johnson throughout the course of the inquiry, bringing up graphs that showed that even with moderate measures, the NHS would be massively overwhelmed as the pandemic grew exponentially. Johnson said that he was “bewildered” looking at the graph and admitted that “there was a certain amount of incoherence in our thinking.” Keith asked why he was presented with this data and still did not consider pressing for more significant interventions. “I remember looking at that graph and thinking that in either case we were facing an absolutely intolerable situation, and though I clocked it, I thought there must be a reason why we aren’t told to act more urgently,” said Johnson. “I was afraid given the advice I was being given about timeliness and looking at the graphs with puzzlement.”Later, inquiry chair Baroness Hallett asked Johnson if he had ever considered not implementing a lockdown at all. The former Prime Minister responded saying that he did briefly consider it but felt it was the duty of the government to “protect human life.” He also said that he wanted to give healthcare workers the best chance he could and that lockdowns were his only tool to do that. Things were equally tense onThursday, when the inquiry panel presented a series of diary entries in which Johnson appeared to favor a strategy that would allow the virus to spread rapidly so that the population could achieve more immunity. Johnson denied he had pursued a strategy that would allow covid to “rip” through the population, saying “if you look at what we actually did we went into lockdown as soon as we could the first time around.” Johnson also opened up about his ICU stay in April 2020. “When I went into intensive care, I saw around me a lot of people who were not actually elderly. In fact they were middle aged men quite like me. And some of us were going to make it and some of us weren’t.”He said that his ICU gave him personal insight into how “appalling” the disease was, and he did everything he could to take it seriously. “To say that I didn’t care about the suffering that was being inflicted on the country is simply not right,” he said. Johnson also addressed “partygate,”the political scandal regarding gatherings of several members of the government that violated pandemic era social distancing rules. “I continue to regret what happened, but the version of events that has entered the public consciousness is a million miles from what actually happened at Number 10,” said Johnson. At least twelve different gatherings during the lockdowns were investigated by the metropolitan police, three of which were attended by Johnson. One was attended by Prime Minister  Rishi Sunak. These gatherings took place as early as May 2020 and went on until April 2021.  Sunak is scheduled to testify at the inquiry next week.",

        "title_text": "U.S. Imposes Visa Bans For Israeli Settlers Linked to Extremist West Bank Violence",
        "body_text": "The U.S. Department of State is set to implement travel bans on any Israeli settlers who are implicated in attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.The move was announced by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, as part of efforts to establish stability in the Palestinian territory where extremist settler violence is rampant, and has worsened as a consequence of the Israel-Hamas conflict.   “We have underscored to the Israeli government the need to do more to hold accountable extremist settlers who have committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank,” Blinken said in a statement. He also reiterated President Joe Biden’s stance that settler attacks are unacceptable. “Today, the State Department is implementing a new visa restriction policy targeting individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians’ access to essential services and basic necessities,” Blinken said. Blinken called on both Israel’s leadership and the Palestinian Authority to share responsibility for upholding stability in the West Bank and curbing attacks on both sides. The statement did not outline the details of any individual visa bans or how many would be implemented, but bans were implemented as of Tuesday.   When asked about the visa ban on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the press the term “settler violence” is derogatory and inaccurate as it can only be attributed to a small group.Here’s what to know about the U.S. visa ban on extremist settlers. The exact details of the visa ban policy are not yet publicly known, but the first bans were valid from Tuesday. As per State Department privacy rules, the affected settlers will not be named or identified.The visa ban would prohibit travel to the U.S. while active, and such bans could extend to an individual's immediate family members. Israeli citizens who currently hold visas for entry to the U.S. will be notified of their nullification, while those who don’t hold current visas and seek one will have their applications rejected, according to the New York Times. The move will also affect the deal the Biden administration made with Israel in September to allow its citizens to travel to the U.S. without a visa using Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) under the visa waiver programme. ESTAs will no longer be granted to blacklisted settlers.Israeli-Americans who hold dual citizenship and do not require visas to enter the U.S. will not be affected by the ban. The U.S. has been wavering in its support of Israel since the Oct. 7 attack saw 1,200 people killed by Hamas and over 240 people taken hostage. The Biden administration has dismissed global calls for a ceasefire—instead pushing for humanitarian pauses in the fighting—and insisted on Israel’s right to self defense, as it carries out a bombardment of the Gaza strip that has killed at least 15,900, according to Reuters, and displaced 1.9 million people. But in the West Bank, which is under the administrative control of the Palestinian Authority and the security control of Israel, instances of violent acts against Palestinian citizens are on the rise. According to U.N. agency OCHA ,over 243 Palestinians, including 65 children, have been killed in the West Bank. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have been expelled from their homes in recent months, per the International Crisis Group, but these instances were still at a 15-year high this year, before the outbreak of violence in Gaza. But violence has not been limited to settlers. Two Palestinian children—nine-year-old Adam al-Ghoul and fifteen-year-old Basil Suleiman Abu al-Wafa—were also reportedly shot by Israeli forces during an assault on the Jenin refugee camp in November. Israeli forces were responsible for the killing of 231 people in OCHA’s death toll for the West Bank.In the first half of 2023, before the Israel-Hamas war, 591 attacks were carried out by settlers in the West Bank—amounting to an average of three instances per day, according to the International Crisis Group. Raids are also being carried out in villages around Jenin, with at least 60 people detained on Dec. 3. The U.S. measures are part of an effort to reach a two-state solution to the decade’s long conflict, which hinges on Israel’s willingness to tackle settler violence and any efforts to forcibly displace Palestinians from their homes. Biden expressed his concern over these instances on Nov. 18 in an op-ed for the Washington Post. “I have been emphatic with Israel’s leaders that extremist violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop and that those committing the violence must be held accountable,” he wrote. “The United States is prepared to take our own steps, including issuing visa bans against extremists attacking civilians in the West Bank.”",

        "body_text": "I woke up Sunday morning, Dec. 3, 2023, to frantic texts from B, a college student I mentor in Gaza through We Are Not Numbers, an organization that helps young adult writers publish stories in English. I’m calling him “B” because Palestinians in Gaza fear retaliation from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) if they publicly speak about their conditions.B texted me internationally, which he never does because it’s too expensive. But Sunday morning he had no Wi- Fi, and he was desperate. “They threatened the [area] where we live, telling [us] to evacuate to Rafah. We don’t have any place to go. Can you help at all?”  He was asking me, an American who lives more than 5,000 miles away and does not speak Arabic, to help him find somewhere safe to go in Rafah.When the IDF resumed bombing on Dec. 1, 2023, it took aim at Khan Younis, a city in the south of Gaza where the IDF in October had told the entire north Gaza population of over 1 million people to go. B and his extended family had followed these evacuation orders, and all 70 people have since been sleeping on the floor of a single large room, with no electricity or clean water and little food. After they fled, their home in Gaza City was destroyed, as was B’s university. The floor in Khan Younis became all they had.Now the IDF was telling them and everyone else in large swathes of Khan Younis to evacuate yet again, this time to Rafah, or to a “safer” area of Khan Younis. The IDF posted a map online, supposedly to tell residents which areas are safe. Criticized for using an online map when no one has electricity or reliable Wi-Fi, the IDF responded that people in Gaza know where to go to stay safe.But B’s family and thousands of others do not know where to go.Read More: What to Know About Israel’s Expanding Ground Assault in GazaRafah, a small city on the border with Egypt, already was a crowded place before Israel’s attacks, with a population of about 267,000 residents. After the IDF’s October order to evacuate the north, tens of thousands more people went to Rafah, even while the IDF continued bombing there too. Terrified families filled every shelter and rented every room.Now B’s family needed somewhere to stay, and they were desperate enough to ask me. I know three people who have family or friends in Rafah, and here’s what they told me:“My family is sleeping in a house that’s half-bombed,” one person said. “They also have nowhere to go. People now sleep on the streets or in their cars. There isn’t any other place to go to.” They continued, “East Rafah has been evacuated as per what I heard and they keep bombing there insanely. Maybe west Rafah is the best. I don’t know. I can’t be sure.”“It’s not only tough, it is impossible to find anything,” another acquaintance explained. “People whose homes aren’t bombed are already at more than capacity and with everyone being informed to evacuate to Rafah even schools are filling up more and more than they first were.”“I asked my friend who lives in Rafah,” a friend emailed. “She told me there was no place there. The situation is so disastrous.”Read More: Listening to the Voices of Young People From GazaI called B and, after many tries, finally got through. He told me his uncles had traveled to Rafah to look for somewhere to stay. Not only were the shelters full, but even buying a tent would cost 1,000 shekels, about $270 U.S. dollars. B’s family of 70 would need multiple tents, and they were out of money, having spent their savings on food and water. I offered to send money but banks are inaccessible and the Western Union office nearby shut down when its owners were forced to flee.I asked B about finding a safer area of Khan Younis, using the IDF map. B said he’d seen the map only briefly when he’d had a couple of minutes of Wi-Fi, but he couldn’t understand it. “It’s all these numbered blocks, but there aren’t any street names and we couldn’t tell which block we’re in, or which blocks are safe,” he said. “Some of the blocks seem to be uninhabitable land with no buildings.”While we were talking, it was getting dark there. Cars that drive at night are often bombed and shot at. The family has only one car for 70 people and would need to make several trips even if they had somewhere to go. They resigned themselves to staying where they were, hoping for a miracle. ",

        "title_text": "What to Know About Venezuela’s Move to Claim Guyana’s Essequibo Region",
        "body_text": "Guyana President Irfaan Ali said on Sunday that his country will be present on the Caribbean island nation of St. Vincent on Thursday for discussions on where border lines between Guayana and Venezuela should be drawn amid Venezuela claiming Guyana’s Essequibo region belongs to them.The meeting was brokered by neighboring Brazil, along with CELAC and CARICOM, intergovernmental organizations representing Latin America and the Caribbean nations. However, it remains unlikely that Guyana will budge on the border issue. “We have no objection to any conversation with Venezuela with the aim of ensuring the peace and stability of our region,”  Ali said in a national broadcast. “However, we have made it consistently clear that the issue of our border is before the ICJ and that is where it will be settled.”Last week, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordered the state’s oil companies to issue extraction licenses in oil-rich Essequibo—increasing tensions between the two countries and reigniting a longstanding territory dispute.This news comes after more than 95% of Venezuelan voters approved a referendum claiming ownership over land—which makes up more than two-thirds of Guyana—with plans to create a new state in the region, though some reports say that voters largely shunned the vote. On Tuesday, Maduro, who is trying to rename the territory Guayana Esequiba, debuted a new map of Venezuela that included the disputed region. “We want the peaceful rescue of the Guayana Esequiba,” said Maduro, who also demanded that Guyanese companies working in the territory leave within three months. “Our Guayana Esequiba has been de facto occupied by the British Empire and its heirs and they have destroyed the area.\"In an address to the nation on Tuesday, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali called the move an “existential threat.”  “This is a direct threat to Guyana’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence,” he said. In the midst of this tension, a helicopter containing Guyanese military officials went missing near the country’s border with Venezuela on Wednesday, sparking a search party and rescue mission. The Guyanese military announced on Friday that it had rescued two survivors and recovered five victims from the crash site. Here’s everything you need to know.The helicopter—carrying two crew members and five Guyanese military officials—vanished during an inspection of troops guarding a contested border that Venezuela claims as its territory. Authorities said dire weather conditions likely contributed to the disappearance, rather than hostile fire from Venezuela. The Guyana Defence Force lost contact with the Bell 412 EPI aircraft after it departed from a fuel stop in western Guyana, Army Chief Brigadier General Omar Khan said, according to the Associated Press. The aircraft was flying over mountainous areas about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Guyana’s border with Venezuela when contact was lost after the aircraft sent an Emergency Locator Transmitter signal at 11.20 a.m., local time.Khan stated there was no sign of foul play when search efforts for the aircraft were still ongoing.“We do not have any information suggesting that there was any flight by Venezuelan aircraft in that area,” Khan said. “Speculation is not what I want to go into. Our priority is to save the lives of our officers and ranks.”The crash site was located within 24 hours. The Guyana Defence Force (GDF) said on Thursday at 11 a.m. that the crash site had been “positively identified” and the aircraft was also spotted. “Search and rescue teams have also reported positive signs of life on the scene,” the GDF said in a statement. “Troops are being rappelled to the exact site location.”On Thursday, the GDF issued a press release that five people on board—Brigadier (Retd) Gary Beaton, Colonel Michael Shahoud, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Charles, Lieutenant Colonel Sean Welcome, and Staff Sergeant Jason Khan—had died. There were two survivors: Lieutenant Andio Crawford and Corporal Dwayne Jackson. The GDF posted on its Facebook page that the search and rescue operation evacuated survivors and victims from the crash site in the mountains of the Mazaruni Area on Friday. The two survivors arrived at 3:55 p.m. local time at Eugene F. Correia Airport after a medical check, and the bodies of the five crash victims arrived at 5:30 p.m. Venezuela has long sought to control Essequibo. Disputes stretch back to 1841, when the Venezuelan government alleged that, in its acquisition of British Guiana (now Guyana) from the Netherlands, the British had encroached on Venezuelan territory. In 1899, the border was decided by an international Tribunal of Arbitration and the region has remained under control of British Guiana and now Guyana for over a century. In 2015, the discovery of oil off of Essequibo’s coast revived the territory dispute over the 160,000 square km (61,776 square miles) region. The region holds strong economic prospects. Guyana’s fast-growing economy is largely driven by gas and oil. For Venezuela, which has faced hyperinflation, international sanctions, and economic crises in recent years, a revival of the country’s oil industry—coupled with a recent ease in U.S. sanctions—could help stabilize the economy.Venezuela’s decision will likely be met with strong international resistance. The case is currently before the United Nation’s top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), though a formal ruling on the disagreement could take years. Last week, the IJC banned Venezuela from taking any action in the region, though Maduro has said the court does not have authority to rule on the dispute. Ahead of Sunday’s referendum, Brazil’s top foreign policy advisor Celso Amorim urged Venezuela to avoid the use of force or threat over the border region. \"Now there are new facts that are still more worrisome. We'll not fail to transmit our concerns especially in relation to the policy of no use of force,\" Amorim told Reuters.On Thursday, the U.S. conducted military drills in Guyana. \"In collaboration with the Guyana Defense Force, the U.S. Southern Command will conduct flight operations within Guyana on December 7,\" the U.S. Embassy in Guyana said in a statement.The embassy noted that the flight exercise \"builds upon routine engagement and operations to enhance security partnership\" between the U.S. and Guyana, and is meant to \"strengthen regional cooperation.\"President Ali told CBS in a Dec. 5 interview that he has reached out to leaders across the globe— including the U.S., India, and Cuba. “Our first line of defense is diplomacy,” he said.In his address, President Ali assured investors that they had nothing to fear, and said he has already spoken to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, and that the matter would be reported to the ICJ and U.N. Security Council. “The Guyana Defense Force is on high alert,” he said. “Venezuela has clearly declared itself an outlaw nation.”",

        "body_text": "Group of Seven nations have agreed to ban Russian diamond imports from the start of next year in the latest move to curb Russia’s ability to fund its invasion of Ukraine.While the G7 and its European allies have been trying to find additional ways to squeeze Russia’s economy to constrain its ability to fund its war in Ukraine, diamonds have remained a stumbling block. Earlier attempts to sanction Russian gems in Europe had met resistance from leading importer nations like Belgium, which had argued that a simple ban would just shift the lucrative gem trade elsewhere. Read More: Why Sanctions on Russia Won’t WorkThe G7 said Wednesday that it will ban all imports of rough diamonds directly from Russia from Jan. 1. That will expand to include Russian diamonds that have been processed in third countries from Mar. 1, with a full traceability system implemented by the start of September.The diamond industry has spent much of the past three months aggressively lobbying G7 decision makers behind the scenes about how the ban should be implemented, focusing on the method used to trace diamonds.Belgium has proposed that all diamonds are processed though the port city of Antwerp, the once-dominant global trading hub that has been steadily losing influence to rival hubs in India and Dubai. Under that scheme, all rough diamonds would have to registered onto a digital ledger in the city before being flown back to major trading and manufacturing centers elsewhere.The proposal sparked strong opposition from many diamond-producing countries and some of the industry’s dominant players, who said it was unworkable and would damage the diamond trade. They proposed another system where the industry would enhance and expand existing models of origin certification.Read More: Russia Produces a Third of the World’s Diamonds. Now They’re Coming Under ScrutinyThe G7 said it will continue to consult with diamond-producing and manufacturing countries on how to design and implement the tracing system.  It also vowed to step up efforts against evasion and circumvention of all the sanctions it’s imposed on Russia.“Belgium welcomes the tracing system announced by the G7 today,” Belgium Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said. “It is an essential step to greatly reduce the flow of money from the diamond trade towards Russia.”A diamond’s origin is clear at the start of the supply chain when it is issued a certificate under the Kimberley Process, which was designed to end the sale of so-called blood diamonds that financed wars. But after that, the stones can become difficult to track.",

        "body_text": "Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed biopic about the so-called “father of the atomic bomb,” was an international summer blockbuster of 2023—except for in Japan, where the film will only begin to be screened in 2024, after concerns about local sensitivities precluded an earlier release in the only country to ever have experienced a nuclear attack.Read More: J. Robert Oppenheimer’s Grandson on What the Movie Gets Right and the One Scene He Would Have ChangedTokyo-based distribution company Bitters End said Thursday that its decision to release the movie in the East Asian nation next year—the exact date remains unspecified—was “made following months of thoughtful dialogue associated with the subject matter and acknowledging the particular sensitivity for us Japanese. After screening the film, we feel Christopher Nolan has created a singular cinematic experience that transcends traditional storytelling and must be seen on the big screen. We invite the audience to watch the film with their own eyes when it comes to Japan.”International screenings of Hollywood movies can be delayed for many reasons, though they are often scheduled close to their U.S. theatrical releases. But while Oppenheimer, which was released in the U.S. on July 21, became a cultural phenomenon for many, particularly as cinemagoers supported the film alongside simultaneous summer blockbuster Barbie, in Japan, “Barbenheimer” memes stirred backlash. Some people have also criticized Oppenheimer for its lack of focus on the more than 200,000 casualties of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer’s creation.Writer, director, and producer Nolan was asked by NBC in July about his decision not to directly depict the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the film, to which he said that it was a deliberate choice to tell the story through Oppenheimer’s point of view. “To depart” from Oppenheimer’s experience, he said, adding that the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos Laboratory director only learned about the bombings and their fallout through the radio, “would betray the terms of the storytelling.” Read More: ‘This Is Hell’: Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Survivors Live in Fear of Another Nuclear CatastropheDespite its delayed release in Japan, Oppenheimer still became the third-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide, earning more than $950 million at the global box office. (Barbie, however, which faced its own release controversies in several countries, ultimately emerged as the more profitable half of the unofficial double-feature, with $1.4 billion in global earnings.)",

        "title_text": "People in China Are Starting to Worry About COVID Testing and Controls Coming Back",
        "body_text": "A year after China abruptly scrapped its notoriously stringent zero-COVID controls and amid a recent surge in respiratory illness cases, some Chinese citizens are starting to worry about a potential reintroduction of the controversial regime of mass testing and restrictions that defined the pandemic years in the country and ultimately led to an unprecedented eruption of public unrest.Concerns coincide with new reports of COVID testing being brought back to airports and hospitals, as well as a notice issued by the education ministry on Monday urging schools around the country to step up prevention efforts for influenza viruses and COVID ahead of winter season. Rumors are also swirling on Chinese social media that the nationwide COVID-tracking app is being reactivated in some provinces, with some users claiming that the app had never been taken down, though censorship of a related hashtag has only fueled more speculation. “Scenes like this make me feel really uncomfortable,” one Weibo user commented under a video of people in hazmat suits disinfecting a school in Hebei province.“There are widespread rumors that the health tracking app is being revived, and worries that there will be another lockdown… These worries probably won’t come true, unless there’s a new pandemic,” wrote another Weibo user. “These worries really represent fear and sadness about the past three years of trauma, and hatred of the abuse of power during COVID.” In recent months, hospitals in China have dealt with a wave of pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses among children. Chinese authorities attributed the surge to cold season, known pathogens, and COVID. The wave has also been monitored by the World Health Organization, which has been in touch with Chinese authorities to provide more information about the respiratory pathogens. In November, the WHO noted that China had enhanced surveillance for respiratory illness since mid-October, covering various respiratory viruses and bacteria, and that the increase of respiratory illness was expected with the arrival of winter. China experienced a sharp resurgence in COVID cases in May, fueled by the XBB variant, sparking worries across the world. But despite projections that China would see as many as 65 million COVID cases per week, public health experts at the time warned against panicking about the possibility of another pandemic emerging. Public health experts have made similar evaluations about China’s most recent surge in respiratory illnesses.Read More: Could China’s Child Pneumonia Outbreak Spread? All You Need to KnowChina’s zero-COVID policy saw lockdowns that spanned neighborhoods or entire cities, the widespread use of contact-tracing apps, regular mass testing, and mandatory quarantine. These measures appeared to yield results, with China claiming a low infection rate for the most part of the two years under zero-COVID (though the reliability of China’s data is unclear). But even as governments in the rest of the world gradually lifted social distancing rules and people returned to their normal lives, China maintained its curbs.As life in China under the shadow of the pandemic wore on, the strict quarantine measures started coming under increasing scrutiny by international observers and the Chinese public: making headlines were reports of health workers breaking into residents’ houses on the hunt for potential COVID infections, authorities killing pets while their owners were in quarantine, neighborhoods being shut in with padlocks and bicycle locks, residents struggling at home with food and medicine shortages. A mental health crisis and extreme loneliness also festered in locked down apartments, though an uptick in suicides was never officially attributed to the pandemic measures.Public frustration came to a boil in November last year, when an apartment fire killed at least 10 people in Xinjiang and many blamed COVID restrictions for hampering rescue efforts. Unprecedented protests broke out in parts of the country, as thousands gathered to air their anger and grievances over the indefinite lockdowns they had been subjected to, mounting what some described at the time as the biggest challenge to President Xi Jinping’s legitimacy the country had seen. Just weeks after the historic demonstrations, China abandoned its zero-COVID policy. Memories of zero-COVID, nevertheless, remain fresh in the minds of those who lived through it: some have learned to take humorous jabs at the widely criticized policy—hazmat suits were a notable costume of choice at a Halloween parade in Shanghai in October—but experts warn that many Chinese residents will take years to recover from trauma.

        "title_text": "U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Faces Leadership Crisis Over Blocked Rwanda Migrant Plan",
        "body_text": "LONDON — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was struggling to avert a leadership crisis on Thursday after his plan to revive a blocked asylum deal with Rwanda triggered turmoil in his party and the resignation of his immigration minister.Sunak called a hastily scheduled news conference to defend his policy after Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick quit the government late Wednesday, saying a bill designed to override a court block on the Rwanda plan “does not go far enough” and won’t work.Jenrick said the government had pledged to “stop the boats” bringing migrants to Britain across the English Channel and must do “whatever it takes to deliver this commitment.”The plan to send asylum-seekers on a one-way trip to Rwanda is central to the U.K. government’s self-imposed goal of stopping unauthorized asylum-seekers crossing the Channel from France.Britain and Rwanda agreed on a deal in April 2022 under which migrants who cross the Channel would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be processed and, if successful, they would stay.The U.K. government argues that the deportations will discourage others from making the risky sea crossing and break the business model of people-smuggling gangs. Critics say it’s both unethical and unworkable to send migrants to a country 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) away with no chance of ever settling in the U.K.No one has yet been sent to Rwanda under the plan, which has faced multiple legal challenges. Last month the U.K. Supreme Court ruled the plan was illegal because Rwanda isn’t a safe country for refugees.The government has refused to drop the plan despite the court's judgment. Britain and Rwanda have since signed a treaty pledging to strengthen protection for migrants. The U.K. government says that will allow it to pass a law declaring Rwanda a safe destination and allowing the government to ignore parts of British human rights law to send migrants there.The government says the law will allow it to “disapply” sections of U.K. human rights law when it comes to Rwanda-related asylum claims and make it harder to challenge deportations in the courts.Home Secretary James Cleverly acknowledged the legislation may violate international human rights rules but urged lawmakers to support it anyway.But the legislation doesn’t go far enough for some in the governing Conservative Party’s authoritarian wing, who want the U.K. to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Almost every European country, apart from Russia and Belarus, is bound by the convention and its court.Sunak responded to Jenrick's resignation by arguing that the bill went as far as the government could.“If we were to oust the courts entirely, we would collapse the entire scheme,” he wrote in a letter to Jenrick responding to his resignation.Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta confirmed that his country would scrap the deal unless Britain stuck to international law.“It has always been important to both Rwanda and the U.K. that our rule of law partnership meets the highest standards of international law, and it places obligations on both the U.K. and Rwanda to act lawfully,” he said in a statement.Sunak has struggled to keep the fractious Conservatives united since taking over as party leader and prime minister in October 2022 after the turbulent terms of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.He has made “stopping the boats” one of his key pledges ahead of a national election that is due next year. He hopes showing progress can help the party close a big polling gap with the opposition Labour Party.But dissent has broken out again over the Rwanda plan. It concerns centrist Conservative lawmakers who oppose Britain breaching its human rights obligations.The bigger danger to Sunak comes from the hard-line right wing represented by Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who was fired by Sunak last month after she made a series of statements that deviated from the government line.She is seen as likely to run for party leader in a contest expected if the Conservatives lose power in an election. The contest could come even sooner if Conservative lawmakers think ditching Sunak will improve their chances.Braverman criticized the Rwanda bill and said the law must go farther, including a ban on legal challenges to deportation and incarceration of asylum-seekers in military-style barracks.“We have to totally exclude international law -– the Refugee Convention, other broader avenues of legal challenge,” she said.Braverman did not answer directly when asked if she supported Sunak as prime minister.“I want the prime minister to succeed in stopping the boats,” she said.",

Since Oct. 7, the 24-year-old photojournalist has dedicated his days to capturing the scenes of death, destruction, and anguish that have come to be associated with the besieged enclave.But as Israel’s punishing military campaign to root out Hamas from the Strip enters its third month, and as its ground invasion pushes further south to where millions of civilians are currently sheltering, Azaiza has warned that he may not be able to continue his work for much longer. “The phase of risking your life to show what is happening is now over,” he told his followers in a statement over the weekend, “and the phase of trying to survive has started.”The fate of journalists like Azaiza matters—not only for Gaza’s Palestinians, many of whom have come to rely on their local press to report what is happening to a world that increasingly feels out of reach, but for the wider international press, which has no means of independently reporting what is happening on the ground in Gaza themselves. For both, they have become a vital source of first-hand information amid what is the worst war to befall the Strip in living memory. Raw and unfiltered, their coverage offers a rare glimpse into life in Gaza that numbers alone—17,000 dead, 100,000 buildings destroyed, 1.9 million displaced—simply can’t capture.None of these journalists are neutral observers, nor do they claim to be. Each and every one of them is simultaneously covering and living the war. Many of them have been displaced from their homes and cities; many have lost colleagues, friends, and family members to airstrikes. Like everyone in Gaza, they have to deal with shortages of food, clean water, shelter, and electricity.“To be honest, I never imagined I would ever report on all of this violence,” Hind Khoudary, a 28-year-old freelance reporter for Turkey’s Anadolu news agency and other outlets, told TIME last month over WhatsApp, one of the few reliable forms of communication amid regular electricity cuts and internet blackouts. Much like Azaiza and others, Khoudary regularly shares photos and videos of her experience amid the war: of the empty supermarket shelves, overwhelmed hospitals, and neighborhoods reduced to rubble. Over the course of the war, Khoudary has seen her home destroyed, her friends killed, and her family separated. She says she is drained and dehydrated. “To report and live the same exact thing is very overwhelming.”If there’s one thing that keeps her going, Khoudary says, it’s “the fact that people are listening and seeing and interacting and this is the best thing that’s making me continue.”The question is how long they can continue like this. “I no longer have any hope of survival,” Bisan Owda, a 25-year-old Gazan filmmaker, told her more than 3 million followers in a recent post. Since Oct. 7, Owda has dedicated her time to chronicling the war through a series of video diaries. Often in English and always filmed selfie-style, her dispatches offer an unvarnished look at the reality of life under bombardment. In one video, she walks viewers through her nighttime routine, which involves gathering her essentials in a bag and keeping her shoes by the door in case her neighborhood comes under bombardment. In another, she captures the resilience of those who, despite being displaced in shelters, still manage to make falafel, a Palestinian staple, over woodfire.Some of the most prominent Palestinian journalists to have emerged from the war have been forced to step back from their work. Plestia Alaqad, a 22-year-old freelance journalist who regularly shared testimonials from ordinary Palestinians about the war, made the decision to flee Gaza last month due to fears that her reporting could put her family’s life in danger. One day prior, she said she would forgo wearing her press vest and helmet, noting that despite being meant to protect her, they no longer made her feel safe. “I hope this nightmare ends soon,” she wrote. “I hope we don’t lose any more journalists.”Her fears are not unfounded. At least 63 journalists have been killed covering the war, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in what has been the deadliest month for journalists since the NGO began tracking journalist casualties in 1992. The vast majority have been Palestinian journalists, with four Israeli journalists and three Lebanese journalists also killed. (Investigations by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse into the Oct. 13 killing of Issam Abdallah, a Lebanese journalist for Reuters, determined that his death was likely the result of a deliberate assault by the Israel Defense Forces on civilians, which constitutes a war crime.) “What are Palestinian journalists supposed to report more than they already reported?” Alaqed wrote to her Instagram followers on Tuesday. “How many more Palestinians are supposed to die for this to end?”Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, tells TIME that although this is hardly the first time Palestinian journalists have been killed as a result of Israeli military action—a “deadly pattern” that was most prominently highlighted by the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh last year—those working in Gaza now face an exponential risk. “What we’re seeing in this war is that this deadly pattern is becoming more deadly,” Mansour says, noting that some Palestinian journalists have reported receiving threats from the Israeli military to cease their work. (An Israeli military spokesperson tells TIME that the military urges all civilians to evacuate active combat areas, which is “falsely mischaracterized” as threats. “The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists,” the spokesperson added.) “That’s why many of them feel there is no more time for them to continue reporting,” Mansour says.  Protections are unlikely to be forthcoming. Israel and Egypt have prevented most international journalists from entering Gaza, and the Israeli military warned international news organizations in October that they could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in Gaza. Those who have been able to enter the Strip since Oct. 7 have primarily done so by embedding with the Israeli military—a process that comes with certain conditions, including a requirement that the military be allowed to review all materials and footage prior to publication. As for Gaza’s Palestinian journalists, they have largely been left to fend for themselves. For them, “infrastructure and protection and safety does not exist,” says Mansour. Absent greater efforts to allow international media to access Gaza and to protect journalists already there, Gaza’s journalists will continue to bear the burden of reporting on what is happening there until the point that they no longer can. “They are on the frontlines and in many ways they are the most needed,” says Mansour. “But they are also the most vulnerable.”",

        "title_text": "For Trafficking Victims Forced to Scam Others, the Nightmare Continues Even After Escape",
        "body_text": "After just two months of exchanging WhatsApp messages, Mark Santos knew the stranger he met online was falling in love with him.“He was very nice,” Santos says, of the unmarried 47-year-old real estate broker from Virginia. “We even celebrated our two months of being together.”Except Santos wasn’t who he said he was. And he wasn’t acting of his own volition.Caught up in a global cyber scam operation, Santos was forced to dupe and build fake relationships with unsuspecting people online in order to swindle them of their money. To do so, Santos presented himself as a young and attractive businesswoman from Thailand whose photos he stole from a random Instagram account.The Virginia real estate broker was just one of hundreds of innocent people that Santos was coerced to catfish. And Santos—a 26-year-old Filipino who requested to use a pseudonym for fear of his traffickers’ retaliation—is just one of an estimated hundreds of thousands of people, mostly spread across Southeast Asia, who have been involved in what is known in Chinese as “sha zhu pan,” or “pig-butchering.”Originating in China about six years ago, the deceitful industry involves scammers targeting those typically in the U.S., Europe, and other Western countries and catfishing victims—that is, creating fake profiles on social media and dating sites and using them to build personal and intimate relationships online. Once a target’s trust is established, and the victim is fattened up, per se, like pigs readied for slaughter, scammers typically introduce a cryptocurrency investment opportunity or other mechanism by which to receive money from their victims, many of whom lose their life savings by the time they realize they were deceived. An August United Nations report estimated that scam centers generate revenue amounting to billions of U.S. dollars. In 2021, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center said it received more than 4,325 complaints of pig butchering, resulting in losses of over $429 million. In Australia, losses amounted to $133 million in the first half of 2022. Actual losses are estimated to be much higher since only about 13% of victims are believed to report their losses.What’s worse about this particular scam is that there are two sets of victims: scammers, like Santos, are often also victims themselves—lured through fake job ads on social media sites or lucrative offers by recruiters, only to be trafficked and held captive by syndicates who run the scam centers. The industry has been so successful that syndicates have internationalized, operating beyond China’s borders into countries with weak rule of law like Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, and recruiting labor from at least 40 countries mainly across South and Southeast Asia.It is difficult to know exactly how many people are embroiled in the scam, but the U.N. report estimated at least 120,000 people may have been trafficked just in Myanmar, and around 100,000 others in Cambodia—figures that don’t yet include victims in other countries.Last week, Interpol announced that a recent international police operation targeting human-trafficking-fueled cyber fraud revealed the “expanding geographical footprint” of this industrial-scale scam. “While the majority of cases remain concentrated in Southeast Asia, Operation Storm Makers II offers further evidence that this modus operandi is spreading, with victims sourced from other continents and new scam centers appearing as far afield as Latin America,” Interpol’s assistant director for vulnerable communities, Rosemary Nalubega, said in a statement.Read More: Inside the Scarily Lucrative Business Model of Human Trafficking“There’s really not a country in the world that hasn’t been targeted or whose nationals haven’t been targeted by these criminal networks, either through the pig butchering scams themselves or by human trafficking. So it’s a problem that really needs the focus of the entire globe,” Jason Tower, Myanmar Country Director at the United States Institute of Peace, tells TIME.Santos was trafficked to Myanmar by Chinese crime syndicates in October 2022, after he responded to a job posting on Facebook. He was one of a handful of Filipinos rescued from a scam compound in Myawaddy in early May.“Once in Myanmar, they find that they really have no choice but to scam. It’s really an option of either scam and make money for the syndicate or potentially lose your life, be subject to torture, be subject to threats of having your organs removed,” says Tower.The result, says Tower, is a global “modern slavery” problem, leaving hundreds of thousands of victims in its wake. Because of the human-trafficking-pig-butchering industry’s worldwide reach and its threat to global security, experts agree that in order to make a dent, authorities have to go beyond reactive solutions limited to raiding scam centers, rescuing trafficking victims, and recovering stolen cryptocurrency. In places where scam centers are spreading, officials need to disrupt how criminals exploit governance gaps. Public awareness campaigns are also essential in preventing human trafficking and educating potential investors about cryptocurrency scams that are only becoming more and more advanced.Read More: Why Crypto Scams Are Driving an Online Crime Boom — And How to Outsmart Them“I think the issue right now is that the criminal syndicates and the expansion of this activity is way beyond the pace of the response by law enforcement,” Tower says. “You’ve got some international mechanisms starting to look at it, and you’ve certainly got a lot of police intelligence starting to get more involved in understanding what’s happening… I think there’s an opportunity to begin getting ahead of some of this activity and preventing it from spreading further. But that’s going to require very deliberate and systematic coordination across countries.”But there is also another area that is often overlooked in evaluating the response to the rise of this particular criminal operation: for many trafficking victims who have escaped—or been rescued—and returned home to their respective countries, the government assistance often stops, even as survivors’ nightmares are often far from over.When Santos finally returned to Manila, after seven months of being trapped abroad and forced to take part in scamming, one of his first stops was a church. He prayed, partly to thank God for saving his life—which felt like a miracle considering he was repeatedly beaten and told his only escape would be death—but primarily to ask for forgiveness for the sins he participated in, however involuntarily.It’s common for people who have been in his same place to experience crippling guilt and continuing fear.“It hurt our hearts that we were able to do that to other people,” Santos says. “I think of them, their situation, although we don’t see them, we feel their emotions. Everything they earned would be lost just like that, only for us to generate income illegally.”The U.N. report highlights how a human rights-based response must be implemented, as victims of trafficking from these scams currently lack protections and access to rehabilitation and legal remedies—and are sometimes even treated as criminals and subjected to immigration penalties. The report also called for authorities to take a long-term and nuanced approach to address the vulnerable situations exploited by traffickers as well as the power asymmetries that often allow impunity for traffickers and deny justice to trafficked persons.“All affected States need to summon the political will to strengthen human rights and improve governance and the rule of law, including through serious and sustained efforts to tackle corruption. This must be as much a part of the response to these scams as a robust criminal justice response,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk says.“Only such a holistic approach can break the cycle of impunity and ensure protection and justice for the people who have been so horrifically abused.”Back in the Philippines, it isn’t just the self-imposed guilt that overwhelms Santos. There is also shame—fueled by his neighbors’ gossiping and judgment—that haunts him, as he wonders to himself how he didn’t see the signs.How had he not known the job offer on Facebook was a ruse? How could he have let this happen? How did he, a marine engineering university graduate, become a trafficking victim?“Sometimes I find myself just staring into space, still finding it hard to believe this happened to me,” he says.The emotions are all understandable, says Katharine Bryant, head of policy and programs at Walk Free, an international human rights group focused on ending modern slavery. Bryant says internal and external guilt, shame, and stigma are common among trafficking victims returning to their communities, even though they had been tricked and coerced. The added complexity of being trafficked into scamming others, makes it “doubly hard in a way to overcome,” Bryant tells TIME. Victims often find themselves having to prove—to others and to themselves—that they’re not actually criminals.Because most victims arrived at the scam centers on tourist visas and overstayed as they were trafficked, officials sometimes charge them with sky-high immigration fees before allowing them to return home. Many find themselves locked in immigration detention for several months after their escape, treated like criminals if they are unable to pay. For those who do make it home, their reputation as scammers makes it difficult to reintegrate or find jobs, increasing the risk of re-exploitation.“These individuals are going through horrific situations that lead to trauma and symptoms of PTSD, which could last for a lifetime. They’ll be working through this when they get back home. They’re also then trying to rebuild their lives,” says Bryant.But many, like Santos, can’t afford to take time to readjust, having returned home deeper in debt than before they left—partly because they were never paid in the months they worked at the scam centers, but also because many are forced to pay a ransom to their kidnappers. Santos is being hounded by his lender, from whom his family had to borrow $7,000 USD in order to secure his release. It’s a hefty sum, growing with unforgiving interest, in a country where the minimum wage is 610 Philippines pesos or $11 USD per day, and he is at a loss as to where to get the money while also trying to cope with such fresh trauma.“It really just completely derails someone’s life. It’s not just a simple case of, you returned home and then you’re able to start again. These things will linger with them both in terms of their physical symptoms and the psychological symptoms they’re facing,” Bryant adds.In his final days at the scam compound, after Santos’ traffickers found out he and a group of others had contacted the Philippine Embassy in a bid to leave, Santos and his fellow trafficking victims were locked in a room for eight days, their wrists tied to bunk beds, and deprived of sleep and food. Their kidnappers threatened to kill them, saying they would only be released if they paid up.Unable to come up with the money, Santos and the others were hit with metal rods on their heads and their bodies for several days, abuse that intensified the more they resisted. Only when their families back home were able to borrow enough money and deposit cash into the bank account of their abusers were they finally escorted out of the compound, thrown into a car, and driven to the river dividing the Myanmar-Thailand border. Once across to the Thai side, escapees are usually picked up by embassy officials or representatives of rights organizations who assist them in flying back home. Colonel Dominador Matalang, the police attaché at the Philippine Embassy in Bangkok that is frequently involved in assisting victims, says they were surprised by the injuries sustained by Santos and his peers.“They were the worst I have ever seen,” he says. Santos came home with the backs of both legs battered and covered in black and blue bruises.“We were forced to pay because we were at the point that we needed to return alive,” Santos says.Abdus Salam currently works as a Survivor Empowerment Officer at Humanity Research Consultancy. In his current role, Salam has also been able to get in touch with and help rescue trafficked fellow Bangladeshis from Cambodia.It’s a dream job for the 28-year-old, who currently earns $700 a month—the same salary he was promised in Cambodia but never received.Salam himself was trafficked in April 2022, recruited by his neighbor, who promised him a legitimate IT job abroad. Once in Cambodia, Salam was sold four times in five months to different syndicates, transferred from one building to another to do the same insidious task of finding innocent people online to steal from. He says he learned to keep his head down and follow the rules, avoiding beatings himself but witnessing his workmates get tortured and electrocuted.For months, he begged for assistance from his embassy and his recruiters to be released, before a fortuitous breakthrough helped bring him home. Salam was part of a group of trafficking victims released during a government crackdown in Cambodia late last year, with the help of the Global Anti-Scam Organization, an NGO that focuses particularly on pig-butchering and which helped finance the exorbitant dues he had to pay the Cambodian government for overstaying his visa. He finally returned to Bangladesh in September 2022.Upon coming home, Salam needed two months to recover from being sick, the result of months of unhealthy eating, working 12–15-hour days, and lack of sleep. Salam is grateful for his family, who despite having mortgaged their house just to send him abroad were nothing but supportive of his recovery, he says: “They did not say a single bad thing or blame me that I got trapped abroad and I lost our money.”This type of steadfast reassurance and care—or even just having someone to talk to—can make a world of a difference for victims, says Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, who runs a hotline mostly for migrant workers but that started getting calls from people from scam centers over the last two years.Outside of work, Salam also successfully tracked down his recruiter—a neighbor and the father of a high school classmate. Salam filed but later withdrew a police report against the man, after he paid back Salam the $3,000 recruitment fees he charged.This avenue to some form of justice—whether it be helping prevent others from being trafficked or holding their abusers accountable—is pivotal to helping victims heal, according to rights advocates. Ultimately, however, Bryant and Harsono say that as much as victims can do to help themselves, their governments need to take greater responsibility to ensure their successful recovery.Currently, governments are focused on tackling the trafficking networks but have lagged in regard to victim care. While many governments have a policy around support for victims—such as training for law enforcement on trauma-informed care—it is rarely implemented thoroughly. Even counseling services offered by the government are not usually sustained or specialized. “The governments need to make sure that they’re providing avenues for these different forms of justice as identified by the survivors themselves… for criminal justice, accessing sentencing for perpetrators, or accessing compensation all the way through to ensuring that people are able to access psychological support, physical health support, as well as ongoing counseling throughout the rest of their lives,” Bryant says.Santos says he was offered a couple of government-sponsored counseling opportunities when he first arrived, which he took, but wishes he could have had more. Salam says he has not received any other form of aid at any point from his government and was fortunate to have been supported by other organizations.“What’s so important,” says Bryant, “is recognizing that this is not something that can be dealt with in a 30-day period and then everyone moves on from it.”That’s a reality survivors already know all too well.“It will forever be with me,” says Santos. “It is now a part of who I am.”",

        "title_text": "Putin to Seek Another Presidential Term in Russia, Extending Rule of Over Two Decades",
        "body_text": "Vladimir Putin on Friday moved to prolong his repressive and unyielding grip on Russia for at least another six years, announcing his candidacy in the presidential election next March that he is all but certain to win, according to state media reports.Putin still commands wide support after nearly a quarter-century in power, despite starting an immensely costly war in Ukraine that has taken thousands of his countrymen’s lives, provoked repeated attacks inside Russia -– including one on the Kremlin itself -– and corroded its aura of invincibility.A short-lived rebellion in June by mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin raised widespread speculation that Putin could be losing his grip, but he emerged from it with no permanent scars, and Prigozhin’s death in a mysterious plane crash two months later reinforced the view that Putin was in absolute control.Putin announced his decision to run in the March 17 presidential election during a Kremlin award ceremony, according to Tass and RIA Novosti state news agencies.About 80% of the populace approves of his performance, according to the independent pollster Levada Center. That support might come from the heart or it might reflect submission to a leader whose crackdown on any opposition has made even relatively mild criticism perilous.Whether due to real or coerced support, Putin is expected to face only token opposition on the ballot.Putin, 71, has twice used his leverage to amend the constitution so he could theoretically stay in power until he’s in his mid-80s. He already is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.In 2008, he stepped aside to become prime minister due to term limits but remained Russia’s driving force. Presidential terms were then extended to six years from four, while another package of amendments he pushed through three years ago reset the count for two consecutive terms to begin in 2024.“He is afraid to give up power,” Dmitry Oreshkin, a political analyst and professor at Free University of Riga, Latvia, told The Associated Press this year.At the time of the amendments that allowed him two more terms, Putin’s concern about losing power may have been elevated: Levada polling showed his approval rating significantly lower, hovering around 60%.In the view of some analysts, that dip in popularity could have been a main driver of the war that Putin launched in Ukraine in February 2022.“This conflict with Ukraine was necessary as a glue. He needed to consolidate his power,” said commentator Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin speechwriter now living in Israel.Brookings Institution scholar Fiona Hill, a former U.S. National Security Council expert on Russian affairs, agrees that Putin thought “a lovely small, victorious war” would consolidate support for his reelection.“Ukraine would capitulate,” she told AP this year. “He’d install a new president in Ukraine. He would declare himself the president of a new union of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia over the course of the time leading up to the 2024 election. He’d be the supreme leader.”The war didn’t turn out that way. It devolved into a grueling slog in which neither side makes significant headway and posed severe challenges to the rising prosperity integral to Putin’s popularity and Russians’ propensity to set aside concerns about corrupt politics and shrinking tolerance of dissent.Philip Short, author of the 2022 book “Putin,” believes the Russian leader had wanted to put in place a political transition before 2024 “so that he didn’t have to stand again,” but that his struggles in Ukraine have forced him to stay on.Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center said Putin “believes that when you serve a state, you can’t leave your post in the difficult situation.”Although Putin has long abandoned the macho photo shoots of bear hunting and scuba diving that once amused and impressed the world, he shows little sign of slowing down. Photos from 2022 of him with a bloated face and a hunched posture led to speculation he was seriously ill, but he seems little changed in recent public appearances.Putin’s rule has spanned five U.S. presidencies, from Bill Clinton to Joe Biden. He became acting president on New Year’s Eve in 1999, when Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned. He was elected to his first term in March 2000.When he was forced to step down in 2008 by term limits, he shifted to the prime minister’s post while close ally Dmitry Medvedev served as a placeholder president.When Putin announced he would run for a new term in 2012 and Medvedev submissively agreed to become prime minister, public protests brought out crowds of 100,000 or more.“He’s a wartime president, is mobilizing the population behind him,” Hill said. “And that will be the message around the 2024 election, depending on where things are in the battlefield.”",

        "title_text": "Sam Altman on OpenAI, Future Risks and Rewards, and Artificial General Intelligence",
        "body_text": "If 2023 was the year artificial intelligence became a household topic of conversation, it’s in many ways because of Sam Altman, CEO of the artificial intelligence research organization OpenAI. Altman, who was named TIME’s 2023 “CEO of the Year” spoke candidly about his November ousting—and reinstatement—at OpenAI, how AI threatens to contribute to disinformation, and the rapidly advancing technology’s future potential in a wide-ranging conversation with TIME Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs as part of TIME’s “A Year in TIME” event on Tuesday.  Altman shared that his mid-November sudden removal from OpenAI proved a learning experience—both for him and the company at large. “We always said that some moment like this would come,” said Altman. “I didn’t think it was going to come so soon, but I think we are stronger for having gone through it.”Read More: CEO of the Year 2023: Sam AltmanAltman insists that the experience ultimately made the company stronger—and proved that OpenAI’s success is a team effort. “It’s been extremely painful for me personally, but I just think it’s been great for OpenAI. We’ve never been more unified,” he said. “As we get closer to artificial general intelligence, as the stakes increase here, the ability for the OpenAI team to operate in uncertainty and stressful times should be of interest to the world.”“I think everybody involved in this, as we get closer and closer to super intelligence, gets more stressed and more anxious,” he explained of how his firing came about. The lesson he came away with: “We have to make changes. We always said that we didn’t want AGI to be controlled by a small set of people, we want it to be democratized. And we clearly got that wrong. So I think if we don't improve our governance structure, if we don’t improve the way we interact with the world, people shouldn’t [trust OpenAI]. But we’re very motivated to improve that.”The technology has limitless potential, Altman says—“I think AGI will be the most powerful technology humanity has yet invented”—particularly in democratizing access to information globally. “If you think  about the cost of intelligence and the equality of intelligence, the cost falling, the quality increasing by a lot, and what people can do with that,” he said, “it's a very different world. It’s the world that sci-fi has promised us for a long time—and for the first time, I think we could start to see what that’s gonna look like.”Still, “like any other previous powerful technology, that will lead to incredible new things,” he says, “but there are going to be real downsides.”Read More: Read TIME’s Interview With OpenAI CEO Sam AltmanAltman admits that there are challenges that demand close attention. One particular concern to be wary of, with 2024 elections on the horizon, is how AI stands to influence democracies. Whereas election interference circulating on social media might look straightforward today—“troll farms…make one great meme, and that spreads out”—Altman says that AI-fueled disinformation stands to become far more personalized and persuasive: “A thing that I’m more concerned about is what happens if an AI reads everything you’ve ever written online … and then right at the exact moment, sends you one message customized for you that really changes the way you think about the world.”Despite the risks, Altman believes that, if deployment of AI is safe and placed responsibly in the hands of people, which he says is OpenAI’s mission, the technology has the potential to create a “path where the world gets much more abundant and much better every year.“ “I think 2023 was the year we started to see that, and in 2024, we’ll see way more of it, and by the time the end of this decade rolls around, I think the world is going to be in an unbelievably better place,” he said. Though he also noted: “No one knows what happens next. I think the way technology goes, predictions are often wrong.”A Year in TIME was sponsored by American Family Insurance, The Macallan, and Smartsheet.",

        "title_text": "Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Reportedly Set to Purge Cabinet Amid Scandal",
        "body_text": "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to replace as many as 15 ministers and junior ministers, the Asahi newspaper said, as he seeks to contain the fallout from a slush fund scandal threatening to paralyze his government. The reported purge of all officials from the Liberal Democratic Party faction formerly headed by the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe comes as suspicions emerge that the group had systematically concealed political funds, the paper said late Sunday. Kishida also plans to oust Abe faction members from senior party positions, according to media reports over the weekend. “I’ll take appropriate action at the appropriate time, to avoid delays to management of the government,” Kishida told reporters Monday, declining to comment further on his plans. The highest-profile among those set to be ousted are Trade Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who has helped drive Japan’s plans to regain its lost status as a world-class chipmaker, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, the top government spokesman. The reshuffle is likely to come after the end of the parliamentary session Wednesday.It’s unclear whether even such a drastic clampdown would stabilize support for Kishida’s government, which is the lowest for a Japanese premier in more than a decade in some polls. While no general election need be held until 2025, the LDP could opt to replace him when his term as party leader ends in September, or earlier.Read More: Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Is Giving a Once Pacifist Japan a More Assertive Role on the Global StageA survey by the Sankei newspaper and broadcast news network FNN carried out Saturday and Sunday found support for Kishida’s cabinet had fallen more than five percentage points on last month to 22.5%, a fresh low since he took office just over two years ago. More than 90% of respondents said the suspicions over funding were a problem and a similar proportion said Kishida should be replaced when his term expires, or before. The long-ruling LDP includes five major factions that raise funds and vie to appoint their own members to government positions, with the Abe group being the largest. Kishida will this time seek to appoint lawmakers who don’t belong to any faction to some senior positions, the Mainichi newspaper said. LDP factions expect each of their members to sell a certain number of tickets to fundraising events. The income from any tickets sold in excess of the target is returned to the individual lawmakers. If more than ¥200,000 in party tickets is purchased by any one person or group, the amount must by law be registered as a donation. According to the Asahi and other media, the lawmakers are suspected of failing to declare about ¥10 million ($69,000) in income per person from fundraising events held by the Abe faction.A loss of power for the conservative Abe faction, which has tended to maintain its late leader’s support for ultra-easy monetary policy, would have the potential to push the yen higher, according to Takeshi Ishida, currency strategist at Resona Bank. Instability in the administration as a whole could cause stocks to fall, and trigger risk aversion, he added. The reports of a reshuffle come after the scandal dominated government briefings and a parliamentary committee session Friday. The opposition Constitutional Democratic Party is set to submit a no-confidence motion against Matsuno to parliament as soon as Monday, public broadcaster NHK said. Previous scandals have already weighed on Kishida’s support, while surveys have shown voters are dissatisfied with the measures he has taken to shield them from the effects of inflation. His policies include extending subsidies on gasoline and utilities to spring 2024 and ordering tax rebates and handouts for low-income households.A poll by the Mainichi newspaper published in November found support for Kishida’s cabinet had slumped to 21%, the lowest for a Japanese premier since 2011. Data released Dec. 8 showed Japan’s economy shrank at the fastest pace since the height of the pandemic in the three months through September, giving voters little reason to warm to Kishida, who took office just over two years ago.",

        "body_text": "An American F-16 fighter jet crashed into the Yellow Sea off the southwestern coast of South Korea during a training exercise on Monday.The crash was first reported by South Korea’s news agency Yonhap. It comes as separate recovery efforts remain underway after another U.S. Air Force aircraft crashed off Japan’s coast last month.The unidentified F-16 pilot ejected from the aircraft before the crash and was recovered by South Korean maritime forces “awake and in stable condition,” said a statement released by the U.S. Air Force’s 8th Fighter Wing, which was in charge of the jet. “We are grateful for the safe recovery of our Airman by our ROK Allies and that the pilot is in good condition,” Col. Matthew C. Gaetke, commander of the 8th Fighter Wing, said in the statement, using the acronym for the Republic of Korea. According to the U.S. military, the pilot is being returned to Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, where he will receive further evaluation, though authorities said that neither his name nor details about his condition would be released. The cause of the accident was not immediately known but would be “thoroughly investigated,” the U.S. Air Force statement said, adding that the further details will only be shared when the investigation is concluded. South Korean authorities have not commented on the crash.The incident on Monday comes less than two weeks after a U.S. Osprey aircraft crashed off the coast of Japan, killing all eight crew members on board. Seven bodies have been recovered as of Sunday. In May, another F-16 crashed into farmland near South Korea’s Osan Air Base during a routine training exercise. That pilot also ejected safely and no civilian casualties were reported.",

        "title_text": "Hong Kong’s ‘Patriots Only’ Local Elections Marked by Arrests, Low Turnout: What to Know",
        "body_text": "The arrests of several pro-democracy protesters alongside record-low turnout on Sunday in Hong Kong’s first district elections in four years—a period that has been marked by the tightening of Beijing’s grip over the city’s government and freedoms and the systematic suppression of opposition or dissent—are the latest signs of widespread discontent and rising apathy in the semi-autonomous Chinese enclave.Despite efforts by the government as well as pro-Beijing businesses to promote participation at the ballot box as well as a 90-minute extension of voting hours due to a technical glitch, only 27.54% of 4.3 million registered voters cast a ballot—a far cry from the 71.23% turnout in the last district elections, held at the height of the city’s mass protests in 2019, when voters overwhelmingly signaled their support for the pro-democracy movement. District council elections, in which locals vote for leaders to handle primarily municipal issues, used to be one of the most democratic in the city. But since Beijing enforced a sweeping national security law in 2020, elections in the enclave have undergone massive overhauls, with an overarching directive to ensure that only “patriots” secure posts in government.Read More: Hong Kong’s Million-Dollar Bounties Are About More Than Arresting 8 ActivistsThe district council election system was the latest to be changed in May 2023. Hong Kong’s chief executive John Lee, who took office last year and has overseen Hong Kong’s transformation toward Beijing’s control, announced new rules that slashed the number of councilors who are directly elected by the public from over 90% to less than 20% and required candidates to be vetted by national security background checks and nominated by pro-government committees so as to effectively bar anyone deemed disloyal to Beijing.On Sunday, police also deployed more than 10,000 personnel to prevent potential disruptions. Several arrests were made, according to authorities, including three activists from the Hong Kong League of Social Democrats, who had planned but were unable to carry out a protest demonstration, and at least four individuals who allegedly incited others via the internet to cast invalid votes or not to vote. After Lee voted on Sunday, he told local reporters that the revamped district council election was the \"the last piece of the puzzle to implement the principle of patriots governing Hong Kong.\"“Today's district councils are no longer the district councils of the past—platforms for sabotaging and resisting the governance authority of the [Hong Kong] government, advocating ‘Hong Kong independence’ and endangering national security,” Lee said.In his congratulatory message to the poll victors Monday, Lee added that the latest elections were “high-quality” and that they “met the objectives of being conducted in a fair, just, clean, safe and orderly manner overall, fully demonstrating an election culture of excellence and the superiority of the reformed [district councils] system.”John P. Burns, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong, tells TIME that the government’s acceptance of the low voter turnout is “disturbing.” “What it means is that they don't really care what the 70% of the people care about or are thinking,” he says. “One of the important functions of the district councils is to canvas opinion in the districts and relay this to the government. So, if this is not done reliably, the government will have no idea what the people of Hong Kong are thinking and they will not make policy that meets the expectations of the people. And this is a dangerous condition that can lead to instability.”",

        "title_text": "Why Colombia’s President is Determined to Ditch the Country’s Oil Wealth",
        "body_text": "The location for my Dec. 3 interview with Colombian President Gustavo Petro is arranged with all the formalities of a bilateral meeting between heads of government. Staff have arranged his seat on the patio of a luxury beachside hotel in Dubai to carefully avoid the sun and placed a Colombian flag on the nearby table. Men with earpieces linger in the background.  But from the moment he walks in, Petro dispatches with the decorum. He’s dressed in a crisp white shirt, jeans, and loafers—no tie, no jacket. And he has no patience for the diplomatic talking points that officials typically deliver from such a post. Climate change is a matter of “life and death,” he says, and the time has come for countries to move past their narrow self interest and antiquated market-based policies. “The presidents come to make some prefabricated speeches that they themselves do not write, generally, that introduce what I would call a ‘correct’ policy,” he says. “That ‘correct’ policy is false.” The correct policy, in Petro’s view, is to ditch fossil fuels. And he is positioning Colombia not only as a key advocate for the global energy transition but also as a test case of how a fossil-fuel-producing country can decarbonize. “What I’m proposing is not jumping into a void, as some denialist voices say,” he says. “Rather, it’s a change in the way forward. A way forward which, from my point of view, can be much more powerful, and prosperous, than the path that we would be leaving behind.”As fossil-fuel interests, at both the corporate and national levels, continue to resist the transition to clean energy, Petro could offer a powerful rebuke, showing how an economy can transform and prosper. Now, he just has to deliver.Climate change is nothing new for Petro, who has worked on the issue for decades and made it a key plank of his presidential campaign last year. In his year and a half in office, he has blocked new oil-and-gas drilling and begun a campaign to ground the economy to its “biological wealth” rather than its fossil-fuel wealth. His international advocacy on the issue comes at an important moment. Fossil fuels have been at the center of the global climate agenda at COP28, the United Nations climate conference now in its final hours in Dubai, and those conversations have rankled some of the biggest fossil-fuel producers whose economies depend on revenue from the industry. Colombia offers an important counter narrative. Even though it is the world’s fifth-largest exporter of coal and an oil-and-gas producer with significant untapped reserves, Colombian negotiators have pushed for aggressive language on fossil fuels, making them a leading voice in the fraught talks. And, while in town, Petro himself endorsed a call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, a proposal thus far shepherded by civil society and small island states, that would provide a concrete pathway for countries to wind down fossil fuels. He is the first leader of a large country and the first of a fossil fuel-producing nation to do so. “For about 40 years now, we have been living from exporting that coal and that oil,” he says. “Yet I’ve wanted to say, first to Colombian society, and now to the world, that even under these circumstances the economy should transition to decarbonization.”Without listening closely, this can all seem a bit radical. Petro, a former guerrilla movement member turned left-wing economist, spooked the markets when he was elected president last year. And in our conversation he remains true to his roots, citing Marx and delivering a critique of the prevailing economic literature on how to address climate change. Market-based approaches, like a carbon tax, are “sort of like the religious expecting the miracle,” he says. And he says that wealth from carbon-intensive commodities is concentrated among the wealthy, posing a political barrier to climate policy. “Human life can be saved if the total wealth held by the richest 1% falls. And that won’t happen through market mechanisms,” he says.But his proposals aren’t totally divorced from the conventional wisdom. Indeed, he has found ways to square the market-based order with his socialist roots. Among other ideas, Petro has proposed using the multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to reduce the debt of low- and middle-income countries in exchange for protecting nature and, in turn, slowing climate change. “Capitalism has the financial system as a central node, which in a certain way is for planning,” he says. “And one must appeal to it to emerge from the crisis.” Applications of such an approach, like these debt-for-nature swaps, have significant buy-in across the globe, though the devil is in the details about how to structure them. As for what he plans to do at home, Petro’s climate program sounds a bit like the other spending programs that have swept the globe, including Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. At COP28, he announced $32 billion in projects to advance green transportation, clean energy, and climate adaptation, among other things.  In many ways, Petro is a unique figure. Despite his populist agenda, he speaks more like a philosopher-economist than a firebrand. He manages good relations with other leaders and policymakers who do not share his ideologies. And his climate advocacy stands apart from many of his left-wing counterparts in Latin America who take an old-school approach and see fossil fuel-created wealth as a necessary source of finance for social services. Petro tries to look forward. He expresses concern about “barbarism” that might be triggered by climate change and the resulting migration. And he fears the possibility of right-wing backlash from related political disruptions. “There is this rational path forward,” he says. “It’s a question of tapping into the scenarios of human rationality that exist today, under, undoubtedly, dominant political influences, and trying, with planning and quickly, to make the transition to another way of producing.”But as much as Petro is an outlier, his approach to climate may be a harbinger of what’s to come. At CO28, we can already see this change happening. After close to three decades of negotiators ignoring fossil fuels in their climate agreements, a global consensus to phase them out is now in play. Petro is just one part of that shift, but, as climate change and the havoc it wreaks become more urgent, it is bound to create a new generation of leaders who think about the issue differently.",

        "body_text": "The Louvre in Paris, the world’s largest museum that is home to over 33,000 works of art, including the Mona Lisa, announced that it will be raising its prices from €17 to €22 ($18 to $24) as of Jan. 15, 2024. The nearly 30% price rise is expected to help offset rising energy costs and a free ticket program aimed toward local French residents. The price hike will go into effect six months before the start of the 2024 summer olympics in Paris. Though the announcement did not mention the games, the city is expected to host over 10 million people for the Olympics, which will take place between July 20 to Sep. 8. Read More: Inside the Radical Effort to Clean Up the SeineIn order to cope with increased demand for goods and services during the games, many organizations in Paris are raising their prices. The price of a ticket on the Paris metro will nearly double from €2.10 to €4.00, though the move has received backlash from city officials. The French newspaper Le Monde reported that hotels are increasing their prices as well. One report from the Paris tourism office showed that hotel prices are expected to rise by 300% from summer 2023 to summer 2024. Laurence des Cars, who was appointed as President of the Louvre Museum, said that the price hikes were part of a bigger project designed to make the museum more appealing to Parisians, who were sometimes dissuaded from attending the museum by the large crowds of tourists. This year, they capped the number of daily visitors allowed at the museum to 30,000, a decrease from the 45,000 allowed before the COVID-19 pandemic as an attempt to bring in more locals to the museum. More than half of French visitors don’t pay for their tickets to the Louvre because they are children, E.U. residents under the age of 26, or members of certain professions. I am happy and proud to see the French public, from Ile-de-France and Paris, reclaiming the Louvre Museum,” said Laurence des Cars in the statement announcing the price hike.” The quality of this relationship is at the heart of our mission. We are working to restore this 'desire for the Louvre' in our local public and try to open new doors for them.”",

        "title_text": "People Around the World Go on Global Strike for a Ceasefire in Gaza",
        "body_text": "In the aftermath of the U.N. failing to pass a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, Palestinian activists and social media influencers are calling for a global strike on Monday, Dec. 11. The Palestinian National and Islamic Forces issued a call for the strike to include “all aspects of public life” for those across the West Bank, and the world. “We expect the entire globe to join the strike, which comes in the context of a broad international movement involving influential figures. This movement stands against the open genocide in Gaza, the ethnic cleansing and the colonial settlement in the West Bank,” the coalition said in a statment. Many activists have also taken to social media to call others to join the strike, calling for individuals to halt all economic activity including going to work, going to school, and purchasing any goods or services.“If the politicians do not hear us, then we can strike from economic life and daily movement, and we can boycott everything, we can put pressure on them to stop supporting and blessing the massacre that is happening in Gaza,” was written on a viral instagram post by Bisan Owda, a Gazan filmmaker with over 3 million followers. The post has 769,000 likes so far. In the West Bank, which is under military occupation by Israeli forces, nearly all commercial activity has shut down, including in East Jerusalem. In addition to shutting down stores, nearly all schools from elementary school to university have also closed. The Lebanese government also announced that it would shut down all government offices and institutions in support of the strike. Since the Oct. 7 attack in Israel by Hamas, the Israel-Hamas war has killed over 17,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, and 1,300 Israelis. An additional 248 hostages were also taken, of which 110 have been released as part of previous temporary ceasefire agreements. Support for the strike has united Palestinians across multiple political factions, including both secular and Islamic parties. Muwafaq Sahwil, secretary of Fatah (the most prominent secular Palestinian political party) in Ramallah and el-Bireh, said that the strike is directly addressing the U.S. veto of the ceasefire U.N. security council resolution on Dec. 8. “This is a message to the U.S. administration that stands against the aspirations of our people,” Sahwil told Al Jazeera.In New York on Monday, protesters gathered in front of the New York Times building to protest the newspaper’s coverage of the conflict and chanted “Free free Palestine, from the river to the sea” The hashtag #strikeforgaza has also gone viral on X, with over 700k posts. The strike has also been taken up by organizations the National Lawyers Guild in the U.S.In Manchester, United Kingdom, and in Istanbul, Turkey videos posted on X show stores that have been closed in solidarity with Gaza. Dina Matar, the chair of center for Palestine studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, says that the strike is also a reaction to frustration and helplessness many around the world are feeling as they witness the violence in Gaza. “They feel that nothing has been done. It's their way of showing that they are engaged in some form of action to support the Gazans,” says Matar. “It gives people the feeling that they are participating and doing something.”Matar says that in order to have a significant enough economic impact to truly be felt, the strike will likely need to continue on beyond just one day. Some activists are planning to continue striking on Tuesday as well. “To all my friends around the world, you are already making a difference by the strike! You are our voice! But today is not enough. Come on, free people of the world, call for the ceasefire and stop the bombing with a strike. Strike tomorrow for another day. Strike until the massacres stop,” posted Bisan Owda on Instagram Monday.  Robert Wood, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington would not support a ceasefire because it would strengthen Hamas. “This is not only unrealistic but dangerous, it would simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on October 7,”  said Wood after the vote. ",

        "title_text": "The Global Immigration System Is Failing. There’s a Better Way",
        "body_text": "From the sands of the Sahel to the waters of the Mediterranean, from the wilderness of the Darien in Central America to the Bay of Bengal, millions of refugees and migrants journey along routes that are synonymous with desperation, exploitation and lost lives. As the heads of the two U.N. agencies that protect and support people on the move, we believe this is one of the great global challenges of our time.The loudest political response has been to claim that only tougher action can resolve it. Most recently, a number European states have announced  plans to “offshore” or simply deport asylum seekers and/or make conditions around immigration and asylum more hostile.Such plans are increasingly in vogue. They are also wrong. They overly concentrate on deterrence, control and law enforcement, and disregard the fundamental right to seek asylum. This approach is ineffective and irresponsible, leaving people stranded or compelling them to take even greater risks.We do not want to understate the scale of the challenge created by today’s population movements. But to meet it, bigger thinking and bolder leadership are needed. The right strategy would tackle every stage of the journey, through a comprehensive and route-based approach of engagement. So, what should such a strategy look like?First, we need to address the issues that compel people to leave home in the first place. Resolving conflicts, improving security, reinforcing human rights, providing sustained and reliable financial support to boost growth and resilience—all address the root causes of displacement and migration by investing in people’s futures. Failing to make these investments and cutting development aid are false economies.Nonetheless, millions of people have no choice but to leave home—protracted conflicts, widescale rights abuses, intolerable poverty, and the devastating effects of climate change are just some of the causes. Yet the same point applies: offer hope and opportunity and people will take it.When it comes to receiving refugees and migrants, it is the world’s lowest-income states that are often the most generous, but they are hard-pressed to include yet more people in their national systems. In turn, this generates onward movement—without work, education, healthcare and housing, who would not want to keep looking for better things?To counter this, wealthy states and international financial institutions should provide countries along these routes with the resources they need, thus also benefiting host communities. Schools, universities, businesses, markets, trade, environmental projects … these are opportunities for everyone, but only if enough of them exist.Wealthy states can also do more at home. The number of resettlement places and alternative paths to third countries for refugees and migrants is comparatively tiny. Visas for family reunification, education or work, seasonal employment opportunities, and access to private sponsorship programmes all provide safe, orderly ways to channel mixed movements and provide alternatives to irregular travel. Scaled up, they can have a real impact.Better management of migration would have multiple advantages. First, it would help to meet employment gaps in wealthy countries, who need this more than many people realise. Labour shortages cost businesses $1.3 trillion a year, and will only get bigger as populations age across the Global North, while 90% of people aged 10-24 live in developing countries.   Second, creating some order in this sector would reduce pressure on asylum systems, with fewer migrants seeing them as the only option for entering a country legally. A comprehensive route-based approach would have one other huge plus: restricting opportunities for criminal traffickers by reducing the pool of people whose desperation they feed on.But this is not just about policies and strategies. It means engaging more closely with the people in mixed movements, such as offering practical and legal advice on accessing protection, to guidance on applying for third-country options. Such a chain of engagement might require new, bespoke models of collaboration but, if done strategically, would address a range of situations.It would also include fair, efficient, and modern asylum and protection systems at the journey’s end, as well as in transit countries. Receiving states can only gain from this: it would let them clear backlogs, deal humanely and legally with refugees and vulnerable migrants, and enable the swift return in safety and dignity of those found not to be in need of protection or who do not have another basis to remain.To be clear, all those who arrive at borders in search of safety must be granted territorial access to seek asylum. Denial of this right, or “offshoring” asylum seekers to third countries or other territories, are violations of international law and acts of cruelty.Two ingredients are essential for our proposals to succeed: cooperation and real responsibility-sharing between governments, even in these divisive times; and attention to every part of the journey. An approach focused mainly on deterrence will fail—indeed, it is already failing.",

        "title_text": "The Voice Notes Poet Refaat Alareer Sent Before His Death",
        "body_text": "When TIME reached out to the renowned Palestinian poet, academic, and activist Refaat Alareer last month to discuss how Palestinian society in Gaza was responding to the deadliest and most destructive war to hit the enclave in living memory, he had a lot to say. “This is something I really like to highlight,” he said in a WhatsApp voice note, noting that he’d been collecting anecdotes and encounters in order to write an essay on the very subject. “I think it’s necessary for people to understand what’s going on beyond the genocide, the bombs, and the massacres.”But Alareer never got the chance. Last week, the 44-year-old was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza alongside six members of his family.Beyond his role teaching English literature at the Islamic University of Gaza, Alareer was perhaps best known for his work chronicling the Gazan experience. In addition to his own writing, which he had published in outlets such as The New York Times, he also edited “Gaza Writes Back,” an anthology of short stories by young Palestinian writers that was published in 2014, and co-edited “Gaza Unsilenced,” a collection of essays, reportage, images, and poetry that was published the following year. To many Palestinians, Alareer was both a role model and a mentor. He co-founded “We Are Not Numbers,” a non-profit established to develop a new generation of Palestinian writers by pairing them with mentors abroad to help them write stories in English. “​​His passion was the English language, but he didn’t teach it as a means of disassociating from society,” Jehad Abusalim, a Palestinian writer, wrote in a tribute to his former teacher. “For Refaat, English was a tool of liberation, a way to break free from Gaza’s prolonged siege, a teleportation device that defied Israel’s fences and the intellectual, academic, and cultural blockade of Gaza.”But to the wider world, Alareer was a prominent, if at times provocative, commentator on Palestinian affairs. On Oct. 7, he caused outrage during a BBC interview in which he defended Hamas’s deadly attack, likening it to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The broadcaster later dubbed the comments “offensive.”Days before speaking with TIME, Alareer re-shared a 2011 poem anticipating that he might be killed, titled “If I Must Die.” In the days since his death, the poem has gone viral, spurring its translation into dozens of languages. Below, in his own words, is what Alareer said about Palestinian society, its resilience in the face of destruction, and his enduring belief in the spirit of generosity, even in the darkest of moments. His account has been edited for length and clarity.The Palestinian community, especially in Gaza, has always been strong. There is always this very strong sense of community, shared responsibilities, people caring for family members, even distant family members. This is part of our values, part of our customs and traditions—not only as Muslims, but also as Arabs, as Palestinians.Even on the level of children and kids. I’m not sure if you hear them in the background, but I’ve never seen the kids in such harmony—playing together, sharing whatever dolls and games. They can fight, they can be naughty sometimes. But they’ve never been this harmonious. I’ve never seen this.The sense of community, the sense of coming together, that we all can be killed at any moment—this sense is bringing us closer and closer. This is not to romanticize war. War is horrible. This sense of doom, the sense of death coming and the gunpowder and the non-stop bombardment. I’m talking to you and the tanks are probably 300 or 400 meters away from where we are in Gaza City. We could die anytime.But we’re clinging to our humanity, and this is what I keep saying. This could end up with the destruction of Gaza. Israelis promised to send Gaza back 150 years, to turn it into a city of tents. We could end up being displaced; a second Nakba, a more horrible Nakba than the first Nakba because this is being televised, streamed online, and on social media.As Palestinians, no matter what comes of this, we haven’t failed. We did our best. And we didn’t lose our humanity.I remember during the first days of the Israeli genocide, I went to a shop and bought powdered milk. Another person said, “Can I have one of these?” And the shopkeeper said, “Sorry, it’s the last one.” And we almost fought. I told him, “No, you take it.” And he said, “There’s no way I can.” And I said, “I have one at home. Please take it.” You must be familiar with how Arabs always fight at the cashier at restaurants, beating each other up to pay. It was beautiful—the man insisting he’s not going to take it, and me insisting to give it to him. But he turned it down, declined politely, at the end.When our building was bombed, we were at home. There was no prior warning and we had to flee, some of us barefoot. We just grabbed the bag—the famous bag in Gaza that families have near the door in every war with important documents, money, cash, women’s gold, et cetera. So we ran away with nothing, no food. We left everything: the flour, the cooking gas, the eggs, the canned food, and we went with nothing to the school shelter and people were welcoming despite the fact that there were too many people. It was extremely difficult. We had very little water, very little food. The next morning, people who knew that we were bombed and came without anything to eat shared their stuff with us. That was beautiful.Three days ago, there was a horrible bombing here. I went downstairs very quickly and there was a woman with two kids, and they were crying. I stopped and took two dates and gave it to the kids. The woman was surprised and the kids were silent; they were no longer crying. I believe it is contagious. Doing good is contagious. It makes you feel accomplished. It’s rewarding in the way you help others. And it makes others help others. And this is what I want—for this to be infectious in the positive sense. And I see people doing this all the time.There was another fight I almost had with a taxi driver. You know, in Gaza, you don’t just take one taxi all by yourself. It’s like an Uber Pool. So you hail a taxi and he keeps taking passengers on the way. So one day, I was in a taxi and we drove for five minutes and there was a mother and her daughter. But before they got in, they said, “But we don’t have money.” And without hesitating, the driver said, “Come.” And at the same time, I said, “I’ll pay for them.” And they got inside and he was like, “No, there’s no way I can take from you.” I said, “There’s no way I won’t pay you because I know fuel is now very expensive.” And he insisted and insisted and of course I paid.The pressure, the starvation, the need for water, is making it even more difficult for people to be themselves, to be generous. And I think it’s going to grow more and more in the coming days. Hopefully, it’s not going to get there. But people are literally starving and rationing. When I was at home, we would ration—eat one quarter and drink one quarter of what we usually do. Now we eat less, we drink less. But it's impossible with the kids. I personally lost like five kilos, but I don’t care. I can eat one date for 10 or 15 hours. I’m a young man. But how would you tell a kid they can’t eat, they can’t have what they want, they can’t drink enough? I keep telling my kids, “Drink less, eat less.”Most people—the majority of people, I would say—would buy food enough for probably a week maximum, leaving the rest for others. And every time I’d go to a shop, I would personally say loudly, “How many of these cans am I allowed to buy?” Sometimes the shopkeepers would be shocked that somebody’s asking. I kept repeating that I don’t want to hoard. I don’t want to make people panic, I don’t want to buy more than enough.During the wars, people come together even closer. Personally, so many things have happened to me and around me—things I saw, things I experienced, things I contributed to personally as somebody with money. Financially, I made sure that my family members around me have enough money to sustain themselves. Same thing with my parents. I also made sure that my friends and people around me don’t need money, that they can’t buy things because they don’t have money.I also offered [my students] financial help. But it’s not easy to give money to people now. The banks and the ATMs are closed. But what I did is tell people that if you need mobile credit to call people, to call your family or friends or to buy some internet package, just contact me. I think I transferred money to about 15 mobile numbers. It’s something I pride myself in, and I know other people do this, people who have access to internet and an online banking account.I teach English poetry this term and I have 200 students. I posted an announcement on our Facebook group telling them I’m sorry that I can’t help enough, I can’t protect them as I should be as a teacher protecting his students. And I asked them to write—to write poetry, Arabic and English articles, and I did help some of them publish articles and pieces and poems as part of my role as a teacher, despite me being extremely under pressure, having my home and my building bombed and having to evacuate to many places and shelters. I usually summarize my policy as, to quote Hamlet, “I must be cruel to be kind.” Tough love. I tell my students, “I'm tough because I love you, I care about you. I want you to be better students.” So I worked them hard in terms of attendance and assignments and tasks and exams. Many students fear me generally in life. In university, even outside, they're usually cautious despite the fact that I try to be as friendly as possible. But again, a tough teacher is always feared, in a way.I was queuing at the bakery and [one of my students] insisted on giving me his place and I insisted, “Never. Because Israel made everybody equal. He’s killing everybody, he’s starving everybody, making everybody suffer almost the same. I would never take your place.”I learnt from this student this beautiful gesture of offering me his place. Because offering me his place meant I could save an hour or more. And sometimes you could queue for two or three or four or five hours, by the way, and when you get close, they run out of bread. So that’s a big sacrifice. Later on, I met [another] student of mine. I was queuing way ahead. He came, heading to the back of the line, and I met him and I insisted on giving him my place, as a reaction to that student offering his place. He was shocked and he said, “No, there's no way.” I said, “I insist.” Of course, he didn’t take the place. He refused. But again, the gesture; the message was there. I’m sure he would do the same for others. You know, learn by example, by role models.Because I taught him to write journalistic pieces, I said, “How are you? Are you writing something?” He said, “I am writing something.” I said, “If you write something, send it to me. I could send it to the Electronic Intifada, to [its editor] Ali Abunimah.” And he didn’t. He hasn’t sent it to me. I think I’ll go check on him, make sure he’s okay. And if he wrote the piece, I can help him publish it.Correction, Dec. 11The original version of this story misstated the publication timing of Alareer's poem “If I Must Die.” It was published in 2011, not 2023.

        "title_text": "Zara Pulls Controversial Ad that Activists Said Resembles Gaza After Calls for Boycott",
        "body_text": "The global fashion company Zara has pulled a controversial ad campaign after pro-Palestine activists called for a boycott of the retailer. The campaign featured statues with missing limbs and mannequins wrapped in white sheets surrounded by rubble. Some activists said that the images were making light of the conflict. “They are making fun of us and they are making fun of children who have been killed and our houses which have been destroyed,” said one activist in a post. Users have been sharing photos of the campaign alongside war scenes to showcase the insensitivity. The hashtag #BoycottZara was trending on X on Monday, while the company’s Instagram was flooded with comments of the Palestinian flag and calls for a boycott. Zara released a public statement on Tuesday saying that photos for the atelier campaign “The Jacket” were taken in September and that the concept was decided in July, before Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7. They added that the campaign was meant to present unfinished sculptures in a studio and “was created with the sole purpose of showcasing craftmade garments in an artistic context.” “Unfortunately, some customers felt offended by these images, which have now been removed, and saw in them something far from what was intended when they were created,” the statement read. “Zara regrets that misunderstanding and we reaffirm our deep respect towards everyone.It’s not the first time Zara has faced backlash from pro-Palestinian activists. In 2022, activists called for people to stop shopping from the brand after a franchise owner of Zara stores in Israel hosted a campaign event for the right-wing Israeli politician Itamar Ben-Gvir in his home.And in 2021, after  the brand’s head designer, Vanessa Perilman sent inflammatory Instagram messages to Palestinian model Qaher Harhash, many online began to call for the designer to face disciplinary action. At the time, the fashion company condemned Perilman’s comments. “Zara does not accept any lack of respect to any culture, religion, country, race or belief. Zara is a diverse company and we shall never tolerate discrimination of any kind,”  the company said. “We condemn these comments that do not reflect our core values of respect for one another, and we regret the offence that they have caused. As a diverse and multicultural company, we are committed to ensuring an equitable and inclusive environment as part of our company values.”",

        "title_text": "China’s Xi Makes First Visit to Vietnam in Years to Counter U.S. Influence",
        "body_text": "When Chinese President Xi Jinping makes his first trip to Vietnam in six years, he’ll be seeking to ensure a strategically important Asian partner hasn’t drifted too close to the U.S.The Chinese leader will arrive in Hanoi on Tuesday with a mission to upgrade ties with his Communist counterparts, the foreign ministry in Beijing said last week. He’s expected to lay down funding for railway lines crucial to exports from Vietnam, a boon for a manufacturer struggling to bolster post-pandemic growth.The two-day trip—Xi’s sole visit to an Asian nation so far this year—comes just three months after U.S. President Joe Biden declared “enormous” opportunity with Vietnam on his first jaunt to the Asian nation. That trip yielded sweeping agreements with the U.S. on everything from semiconductors to security. “China would want to pressure Vietnam not to go too far to these other countries,” said Lye Liang Fook, a senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute who has spent two decades researching Chinese foreign policy. “I think Vietnam is one country in Southeast Asia that knows how to balance this relationship.”The Biden administration’s push to limit China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific, along with Beijing’s sweeping territorial claims in South China Sea, has forced nations such as Vietnam into a delicate balancing act between the world’s largest economies. Hanoi will be mindful of that balance as it seeks economic opportunities from its biggest trading partner this week. Vietnam has been wary China will use its economic and military might to assert more control in the South China Sea, where they have overlapping claims and the U.S. is providing growing security assistance.The geopolitical and economic landscape is much changed since Xi’s last trip to Vietnam in 2017, which overlapped with then U.S. President Donald Trump’s state visit around an economic summit where the superpowers jostled for influence. Vietnam has since emerged as one of the biggest winners from U.S.-China trade tensions, as businesses redirect billions of dollars from China to the manufacturing powerhouse in a bid to secure supply chains.The Southeast Asian nation has adopted a more inclusive approach to growth, evident from strengthening ties with the U.S. and its allies. During Biden’s September trip, the two nations formally upgraded ties, shifting the relationship to a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” the highest level and the one it uses for China and India.“Vietnam’s maneuvered its diplomatic strategy to stay independent while upholding its stability and development,” said Le Dang Doanh, an economist and former government adviser to Hanoi.Last month, Japan and Vietnam elevated ties while underscoring their adherence to international law and territorial integrity. Both nations are embroiled in territorial disputes with China. Tokyo also pledged to provide security assistance to Vietnam, after offering a coastal surveillance radar system to the Philippines, as Manila locks horns with Beijing in the South China Sea.Such moves haven’t gone unnoticed by China. In October, Xi urged Vietnam to remember its “traditional friendship” with its neighbor during a meeting with President Vo Van Thuong in Beijing.Xi’s trip will be a chance to nurture that relationship. The Chinese leader will be greeted at the Presidential Palace, followed by a 21-cannon salute on Tuesday before holding talks with top leaders, according to a schedule distributed by Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Those talks will include economic carrots from Xi. China is ready to provide funding to upgrade Vietnam’s railway from Guangxi province in southwestern China to Hanoi, and accelerate construction on other lines, Chinese ambassador to Vietnam Xiong Bo told state media at a briefing Sunday.Vietnam’s Permanent Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Minh Vu also said the two sides are expected to establish a “new level” of bilateral relations, according to Vietnamese state media.One way Xi may try to pull Hanoi onside is by pressuring it into supporting its loosely defined foreign policy vision known as a “global community of shared future.” said ISEAS’s Lye. That vision starts in Asia, Xi said in a letter published by Vietnam’s communist party newspaper ahead of his visit. “Asia is our common home,” he said. “Neighboring countries cannot be moved away. Helping one’s neighbor is helping oneself.”Thorny topics are also on the agenda, with Xi set to discuss defense and maritime issues with senior leaders including Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, China’s Foreign Ministry said last week.Vietnam and China have a tense military history: They fought a brief border war in 1979 and have clashed over control of island chains in the South China Sea, including in 1988 when a Chinese naval attack killed dozens of Vietnamese border guards on Johnson South Reef. China has since built the world’s largest naval fleet and last year its Coast Guard maintained near-daily patrols in oil-producing waters off Vietnam’s coast. Hanoi has accelerated reclamation activities in the disputed Spratly Islands and repeatedly urges China to respect its sovereignty.While similar tensions with China have helped push the Philippines toward the U.S., Vietnam has looked to prevent such issues derailing the overall relationship. Over the summer, it pledged to maintain its so-called “four nos” defense policy that warns against military alliances, picking sides, hosting foreign military bases or using the threat of force in international relations.Despite all that, Vietnam is likely to want some reassurances from Beijing over its military ambitions, as Hanoi presses its advantage after being recently courted by the U.S..“They are after positive commitments on that,” said Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia, referring to the South China Sea. “That’s the major irritant in bilateral relations and there’s nothing that’s been done to make it better.”",

        "title_text": "Japanese Former Soldiers Found Guilty in Landmark Sexual Assault Case",
        "body_text": "Three former Japanese soldiers were found guilty of sexual assault in a case that has drawn attention to rampant harassment in the country’s military and complicated its efforts to recruit more women.The Fukushima district court sentenced the men to two years in prison, in line with prosecutors’ demands. The sentences were suspended for four years, according to the court.Rina Gonoi, the 24-year-old victim, took the rare step of going public with her accusations, drawing widespread attention in Japan, where individual victims of such crimes rarely speak out in public against their assailants. Among previous, high-profile examples was journalist Shiori Ito, who in late 2019 won damages in a rape case against a prominent television journalist — a decision upheld by the Supreme Court of Japan in 2022.Read More: Rina Gonoi Is on the TIME100 Next 2023 ListGonoi’s case also comes as the government is struggling to fill recruitment quotas amid a demographic crunch and increasing security challenges posed by China and North Korea.Gonoi said she endured frequent harassment after joining the SDF in 2020 and that in 2021 the defendants physically pinned her to the ground and pressed their bodies against hers in a sexually suggestive manner in front of several other colleagues.The three men said they were initially forced to apologize but that there had been no assault.Gonoi has said that as a child she wanted to join the SDF after seeing troops helping victims of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, but she quit in 2022, struggling with mental health issues following the assault. After prosecutors and the Ministry of Defense failed to help, she turned to social media, making her case on YouTube and starting an online petition, which eventually gained media attention, forcing officials to take action.Gonoi eventually won an apology from the ministry, which confirmed the allegations and dishonorably discharged the three defendants, along with two others who haven’t been charged, last year. She was recently chosen by the BBC for its worldwide list of 100 influential women, while also becoming the target of online abuse. Gonoi said the defendants’ lack of contrition was particularly distressing.“These past years have been hellish,” Gonoi, who now occasionally teaches judo, told Bloomberg News ahead of the verdict. “I had hoped they’d express remorse, but there was none,” she said. “It was a bit of a shock. I felt hopeless.” Gonoi, who has also filed a civil case against the government, said she hoped her case would draw more attention to victims of harassment and assault. Following her claim, the Ministry of Defense conducted a survey that found over 1,300 cases of harassment in different branches of the defense forces.Read More: Japan Sends Male Minister to Lead G7 Meeting on Women’s EmpowermentThe survey also found that reported incidents were frequently covered up or dismissed by superiors, who also pressured victims to quit if they pushed for probes to continue. The SDF has struggled to attract sufficient recruits, even as it strives to build up its capabilities to deal with rising military challenges posed by China and North Korea. Its reputation for harassment isn’t helping.“Elite female officers are saying enough is enough. They do think change, and getting in line with global standards, is now overdue,” said Fumika Sato, a professor at Hitotsubashi University specializing in gender studies and military affairs. She added that a culture of fear around challenging the male-dominant status quo has perpetuated harassment.   Gonoi said the SDF’s initial reluctance to deal with her case had left her disappointed and feeling the military wasn’t up to the job of providing the nation with security.“If even those in upper ranks lack humanity and a strong sense of justice, perhaps they cannot protect people,” she said.",

        "body_text": "Puma will terminate its sponsorship deal with the Israeli Football Association (IFA) in 2024, but the sportswear brand says the decision is unrelated to the Israel-Hamas war. A spokesperson for the German brand told TIME in a statement that the decision was made at the end of 2022 as part of its new “fewer-bigger-better” business strategy. “The review of the existing roster of national teams along certain KPIs such as commercials and participation in major international tournaments led to a few changes,” the statement added.A sponsorship deal with Serbia will also expire in 2024. Puma lost its most prominent soccer sponsorship deal, with Italy, in 2022 to rival sportswear brand Adidas. The company’s statement added that new sponsorship deals with two national teams, including a high-profile squad, will be announced later this year and in 2024. The Financial Times first reported that Puma’s IFA decision was financial, according to several people familiar with internal discussions. Israel ranks 75th of 200 countries in FIFA rankings and Israel is a limited market for kit sales, the newspaper added. But the news comes amid calls for consumer boycotts of Israel amid its ongoing bombardment of Gaza. Puma stores in some Western cities have been the target of protests in recent weeks.Read More: Zara Pulls Ad that Activists Said Resembles GazaAt least 18,000 people in Gaza have been killed following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which killed 1,200 people. Some 1.9 million out of Gaza’s 2.2 million people have also been displaced and the U.N. has called for an immediate ceasefire, warning of a worsening humanitarian crisis.Activists had previously accused Puma of supporting Israeli settlements in the West Bank because the IFA has clubs in them. But Puma has denied the allegations, saying it only sponsors the national squad.   ",

        "body_text": "At least 23 troops were killed and 32 others injured in a gun and suicide bomb attack in a police station in Dera Ismail Khan, northwest Pakistan, on Tuesday. A new Pakistani Islamist militant group called Tehreek-e-Jihad Pakistan (TJP) claimed responsibility. In a press release, the Pakistani military said that the attack in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was carried out by six militants using an “explosive-laden” vehicle. The military and local police also told the Associated Press that a shootout lasted for hours before the six militants were gunned down. Separately, a military statement said that “troops killed 27 insurgents” in multiple operations in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region.“Sanitization operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist present in the area, as security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthens our resolve,” the Pakistani military said. The death toll from the gun and suicide bomb attack is expected to climb as some of the officers remain in critical condition, the Associated Press reported. TJP is a relatively new militant group—established in February 2023—that has been involved in multiple attacks against Pakistani security and military personnel this year. That includes one in July that killed 12 Pakistani soldiers in the southwestern Balochistan province. The group has claimed affiliation with the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban, or TTP. Pakistan has undergone a period of instability this year as its government faces a severe economic crisis and political unrest. The former Prime Minister of the country, Imran Khan, was forced out of office after a vote of no-confidence in April 2022. The current caretaker Prime Minister of the country is Anwar ul Haq Kakar. The Pakistani Taliban have stepped up attacks on security forces in the country since 2022. Pakistani authorities say TTP has become emboldened since the Taliban takeover of neighboring Afghanistan in 2021. ",

        "title_text": "The Horrors I’ve Seen Treating Patients at Gaza’s Remaining Hospitals",
        "body_text": "I have been working day and night at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza for more than a month and a half, sometimes performing up to 20 reconstructive surgeries a day. Removing dead tissue from burns. Performing skin grafts. Handling stump closures for amputees. I have spent weeks sleeping in the hospital so no time is wasted—if I sleep at all. Before the war, my wife, our three children, and I lived in the beautiful Al-Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. I worked at a small hospital run by Doctors Without Borders. But when Israeli airstrikes began in the wake of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, Al-Rimal was turned to rubble. My family fled our home on Oct. 10, moving from place to place. A night at my brother-in-law’s house. A night at a UNRWA school serving as a makeshift shelter. Another night at my brother-in-law’s. Then, on Oct. 23, we finally fled south to Khan Younis.Read More: ‘Our Death Is Pending.’ Stories of Loss and Grief From GazaGaza’s health care system has almost completely collapsed as a result of Israel’s ongoing bombardment. Hospitals and ambulances have been repeatedly attacked. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, more than 250 medical workers have been killed so far, including two of my colleagues from Doctors Without Borders, who died while performing their duties in Al-Awda hospital in northern Gaza. Of Gaza’s 36 hospitals, only 11 are still functioning in any capacity, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals in the north like Al-Shifa are barely functioning at all, as basic medicines and fuel have run out. My colleagues have been performing amputations by flashlight and without anesthesia. When Israeli soldiers raided Al-Shifa a few weeks ago—a move the head of the WHO called “totally unacceptable”—doctors and staff were forced to abandon patients too sick or injured to evacuate. Some of those who refused to leave, including the hospital’s director, were arrested, alongside dozens of others. At Al-Nasr Children’s hospital, soldiers ordered staff to leave the patients, including four premature babies who required oxygen, who were later found dead.At Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, we have been inundated with injured patients, many times our capacity. Patients line the corridors. Many lie on the ground as we do not have enough beds. Day after day, I’m presented with patients who have major burns, severe tissue loss, and exposed bones. Our first and most important goal is to save lives. If possible, we also save their limbs. In the last two months, I’ve performed surgeries on dozens of amputees.The hardest cases are the injured patients who were in northern Gaza hospitals, where I returned yesterday, to continue my work at Al-Aqsa where I’m most needed. My colleagues at hospitals in the north have been operating without electricity, antibiotics, gauze, or even water. Patients with limbs that should have been saveable came to us with advanced gangrene and had to be amputated. One patient had burn wounds infested with worms. I see victims with burns that shouldn’t be life-threatening, yet they’re in an irreversible septic condition. I try as hard as I can for each patient, knowing they’ll likely die the next day of the body's cascading reaction to infection. Day blends into night, which blurs into the next day. I’ve grown used to pushing through the exhaustion. Once or twice a week, while I was still in Khan Younis, I managed to go to where my family was sheltering and spend an hour with my wife and kids before returning to Nasser hospital. I try to call them every day, comforted to hear they’re still alive. But it’s growing more harrowing. On Dec. 2, a building about 300 ft. from them was hit by an airstrike, shattering their windows. The next day, the Israeli military ordered people from their neighborhood in the city center to flee. Communication services were cut again for hours and I didn’t know where they were, finally learning later that day that they moved to a tent in what Israel is calling a “safe zone.” On Dec. 11, they fled once again to Rafah, further south. But airstrikes continue to kill people in these so-called “safe zones.” I ache to be by their side. But I have a duty to my patients.Read More: The Struggle to Save Lives Inside Gaza’s Hospitals The WHO has warned that there are “worrying signs of epidemic diseases” in Gaza, with only one toilet for every 150 people and one shower for every 700. Until now, hospitals in the south have been functioning, albeit at a breaking point. Supplies to Gaza’s hospitals were partially replenished during the 7-day truce last month, but doctors are rationing gauze and other medical supplies. I worry about my colleagues and patients still at Nasser hospital. It may be days, it may be minutes, before Israeli tanks surround hospitals in southern Gaza.I am not concerned about my fate. My only concern is that I will not be able to treat my patients. What gives me strength to continue is the knowledge that many people worldwide are working to stop the violence. We need them to continue raising their voices. And we need Western leaders like President Biden to insist on a permanent ceasefire. I pray the carnage will stop soon. Until it does, I will go where I am needed most, and continue to serve my people and to save lives.",

        "title_text": "Inside the Little-Known U.S. Arms Control Center in Daily Contact With Russia",
        "body_text": "On Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. prepared for a dramatic and sudden military response to the worst attack on American soil in the country’s history. But there was a problem. Normal military communications between the U.S. and Russia had been severed after a hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon. As the U.S. sought to move its military forces to the highest state of peacetime readiness, there were concerns that this might raise alarm bells in Russia.One line to Moscow was left standing. “At this time the United States has moved to DEFCON THREE (3). This is not directed at Russia, this is due to current emergency situations,” the message read, sent to the Russian Ministry of Defense, on the banks of the Moskva River. Since 1988, the State Department’s Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (renamed the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Center in 2021) has maintained a direct line to the Russian Armed Forces.In the corner of their office today, in a windowless room on the fifth floor of the State Department in Washington D.C., hangs a framed printout of the message sent to Moscow. It's the clearest distillation of the NNRRC’s task to date, State Department officials say: to avoid the chance of misunderstandings leading to an accidental conflict between the two superpowers.Established after a string of near-misses that nearly led to an all-out nuclear conflict during the Cold War, the NNRRC became the central nervous system for the U.S.’s arms control efforts, receiving thousands of notifications every year about weapons movements, warhead numbers, and military exercises from Russia and other partners. Today, the center takes in messages from over 50 countries in service of a range of treaties covering nuclear, conventional weapons, chemical, and cyber issues. Read More: The Collapse of Global Arms ControlEven so, there is little doubt that the connection to Moscow is the center’s most important line. The NNRRC has two back-up facilities and its lines to Russia go along both satellite and undersea cables to ensure that the system stays up and running no matter what. At any given time, a handful of case officers staff the center, sending regular messages to their Russian counterparts. On a series of large monitors, messages arrive in a mix of Russian and uneven English every two hours. The walls of the center are lined with rosy-tinted pictures from the tail end of the Cold War, depicting the signings of the founding of the NNRRC and other arms control agreements. During this golden age of arms control, the U.S. and the USSR were able to cooperate on a key set of treaties that contributed to an 85% reduction in the nuclear stockpiles controlled by the Kremlin and the White House. Today, that era feels increasingly distant. Few parts of the U.S. government are in as regular contact with Moscow as the NNRRC, and communications between the U.S. and Russia have slowed down dramatically since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has opted out of a number of landmark arms control agreements, and as the U.S. and Russia stop sharing information about their military forces, arms control experts fear that the risk of nuclear miscalculation is once again on the rise.Up until March of this year, the NNRRC received more than 1,000 messages annually from Russia, overwhelmingly under the New START Treaty. But after Russia suspended New START and a number of other arms control agreements, the day-to-day updates about Russia’s nuclear forces have stopped coming in. All that is left is the occasional notification about ballistic missile launches, a last holdover from an era where Russia and the U.S. cooperated on arms control.So far, it appears that Moscow is content to keep on staffing its NRRC. A State Department official says that the day-to-day communications have continued unabated. “It seems that they share our view that there is a great value in maintaining this line,” says the official.“The fact that the Russian government is committed to keeping the NRRC platform going is really one of the small positive signs that we have to keep holding on to at this point,” says Rose Gottemoeller, former Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security and co-author of a recent report on the NNRRC.But the total notifications coming from Russia following the suspension of New START will likely amount to less than 10% of what they were in 2019, before COVID caused a temporary reduction in communication, officials say. “A massive reduction in notifications,” says William Alberque, an arms control expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, “means a massive reduction in the sharing of information that the two sides use to prevent accidental conflict or ruinous arms races and an increase in the risk of potential conflict.”Read More: Here’s How Bad a Nuclear War Would Actually BeOver time, nuclear experts fear, each side's picture of the other’s nuclear arsenal will grow ever more opaque, increasing the chance of misunderstanding. “That lack of certainty may actually encourage things like an arms race,” says Alberque.While “we don't depend on notifications alone to understand the status of the Russian strategic nuclear force,” Gottemoeller says, “we have lost something there. There's no question about it.” While the NNRRC continues its task of reducing the risk of accidental nuclear escalation, it was not designed as an arena for nuclear negotiations or to prevent purposeful escalation. For this, more traditional diplomatic efforts are needed. For months, the administration has been pushing to bring an uncooperative Russia back to the table for arms control talks. In June, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the U.S. is seeking dialogue with both Russia and China on nuclear arms “without preconditions.” Jill Hruby invited international observers to the nuclear test site in Nevada, to prove that the U.S. is not breaking the three-decade long ban on nuclear testing. And Washington D.C. has sent a set of informal arms control proposals to Moscow, Russian officials have confirmed.So far, however, there’s been nothing but crickets from Moscow. The Russian embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to a request for comment. “They may not engage with us, and that’s a challenge,” says a senior State Department official, requesting anonymity to speak candidly. And when asked about the U.S. proposal by Izvestia, a Russian newspaper, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, “the situation is not conducive to the exchange of notifications, even on such key issues.”Few arms control experts expect a quick reopening of talks between the U.S. and Russia. “Unless this situation in Ukraine comes to some kind of solution which both U.S. and Russia can live with,” Russia and the U.S. seem unlikely to return to the table for serious talks, says Andrey Baklitsiy, an arms control expert at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research.Read More: She's Spent a Decade Fighting to Ban Nuclear Weapons. The Stakes Are Only Getting HigherBut in the absence of an arms control breakthrough, the NNRRC will continue its work maintaining and preserving the emergency line between the U.S. and Russia. Many experts say that establishing a similar risk reduction line with Beijing and other nuclear states could be a realistic move towards reducing the world’s growing nuclear risks.At the NNRRC, they are taking steps to prepare for such an eventuality. The center is experimenting with machine translation in the case they eventually reach the limit of how many languages they can staff the center with 24/7. In the meantime, watch officers will remain quietly at their computers, monitoring the lines.",

        "title_text": "I Saw the Haunting Reality of Palestinian Child Prisoners",
        "body_text": "On the afternoon of Feb. 24, 2012, Israeli soldiers arrested me during the annual march to reopen Shuhada Street, in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron. The street was once home to a popular market frequented by Palestinians until the Israeli military sealed it off to us in 1994. Palestinians have been protesting to reopen the road, which we call Apartheid Street, every year since 2010.What happened after my arrest that day still haunts me. As thousands of us marched toward Shuhada, the Israeli military began firing teargas and rubber bullets. A few of us ran for cover and found ourselves face-to-face with Israeli soldiers. One of my friends was injured after being hit by a teargas cannister, and I started tending to him. But the soldiers began harassing us, and I told them: “We do not fear you. This is Palestine. You should step back.” The soldiers pepper sprayed me and pinned me to the ground. They slammed my head against a humvee and threw me into the back of the vehicle. About five minutes later, as they drove through the old city of Hebron, the humvee suddenly stopped, Israeli soldiers rushed out, and a boy began screaming. He was handcuffed and thrown in. He had been walking to his sister’s house for lunch when they picked him up.When we arrived at the Israeli military outpost in the Kiryat Shmona settlement the soldiers dragged us out of the humvee. The kid, who was 14, was terrified. He pleaded with them not to pepper spray him, having seen me not be able to open my eyes. They smacked him around and told him to shut up. They then shackled my feet and had me sit on a bench outside the interrogation room, walking the boy in for questioning first. The Israeli military interrogator told him: “I can make your family’s life hell. But I’ll let you go home. You just need to confirm that the guy with you led the protest and told you to throw the stones at us.” The boy started sobbing and said: “But I don’t know this guy. I just met him when you picked me up.” The interrogator kept pressing him, at one point raising a pistol to his face. The charge brought against this poor kid was stone throwing, based on the “testimony” of Israeli soldiers. The soldiers also accused me of assaulting them, which could have resulted in me spending up to three years in prison. They put me in solitary confinement for two days in a holding cell in the settlement. They then moved me to a heavily crowded underground holding cell in the Maskobiya prison in East Jerusalem, to await a military court hearing. But as a well-known activist, American citizen, and recent Stanford graduate, my case gained international attention. I was also lucky, as videos of my arrest emerged, showing that I did not assault the soldiers and that their testimony was false. I was released on Feb. 29 but the child was not as fortunate. I would later learn from prisoner-rights organizations Defence for Children International and Addameer that he spent three months in prison after being advised by lawyers to admit to stone-throwing so he would get out of jail sooner. Waiting for a ruling from Israel’s military courts can take months or more.This is far from an isolated incident. Between 500-700 children are arrested a year. Israel denies mistreating prisoners but the majority of detained children are beaten, as I was that day, according to research by Save the Children. With a 95% conviction rate, according to the nonprofit Military Court Watch, lawyers and kids know it’s better to “confess” even if they are innocent, as waiting for a ruling and being stuck in limbo in an Israeli jail is hell. The world has turned a blind eye to this for years. Again and again and again. Just look at recent events. While the world celebrated the hostage deal and the return of Israeli and Palestinian loved ones to their families, Israel’s revolving door of arrests continued largely unnoticed. Almost as many Palestinians have been arrested as released, according to Palestinian prisoner associations. We know from recent reports from organizations like Military Court Watch as well as graphic videos showing Israeli soldiers beating, abusing, and tormenting children, that many will face what no child ever should. Living in the West Bank, and after years of monitoring child arrests as part of leading Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq from 2012 to 2014, and now at global civic organization Avaaz, I see the systematic arrest of children as designed to achieve two goals. The first is what Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have described as pursuing an “intent to dominate” and “systematic oppression” to maintain the system of apartheid. Palestinian children in the West Bank are often snatched away in the dead of night, subjected to questioning in the absence of any parent or guardian, and languish in pretrial detention for agonizingly long periods. This brutal treatment is not just anecdotal but is reflected in chilling statistics: 72% of Palestinian children arrested in the West Bank endure prolonged custody until the conclusion of legal proceedings, a stark contrast to the 17.9% of Israeli children subjected to similar conditions, according to HRW. The second goal is to indoctrinate these children with learned helplessness. The military experience suffocates a child’s sense of agency. They can miss a school year, end up being in classes one year younger than their friends, and often have unhealed trauma. These chilling facts, along with my arrest in 2012, are what inspired me to work with kids in areas with many arrests. I consulted with experts in children’s psychological health, lawyers, activists, and former prisoners to develop a curriculum for what children should do if detained. The training includes walking the children through what to expect, self-awareness and meditation tactics to calm their nerves, and legal knowledge, as well as providing community support for children who have gone through this experience. Yet this can only do so much. We need all violence against Palestinian children, including arbitrary detention, to end. The world has largely watched in horror as Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has left at least 18,000 people dead, over 7,000 of whom are children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The victimization of Palestinian children is profound enough that one Hebrew University law professor has coined a word for it: “Unchilding.” The international community must act to stop the  suffering of children, whether they are under bombardment, siege, or in detention. All children deserve dignity, protection, and a life free from fear. Palestinian children should be no exception.",

        "title_text": "Zelensky Doesn’t Appear to Convince Republicans on Ukraine Aid During Congress Visit",
        "body_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky encountered stern opposition from Senate Republicans on Tuesday as he sought approval for billions of dollars in additional U.S. military assistance for Ukraine’s ongoing war against Russia.During a day of meetings on Capitol Hill, Zelensky underscored the urgency of increased American assistance to counter Russian aggression and protect Europe from further advances. But his appeal failed to sway GOP members whose support he would need to pass new funding. Several Republican senators emerged from the meeting unmoved, reiterating their stance that any new aid to Ukraine must be contingent on the Biden Administration and Democrats acceding to their demands for stricter immigration measures at the U.S. southern border.\"I told President Zelensky, 'Here’s the problem: It’s got nothing to do with you,'\" said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the vocal opponents of additional Ukraine aid. “You’ve done everything anybody could ask of you. This is not your problem here.\" Graham placed blame on the Biden Administration for policy choices leading to what he described as a \"nightmare on the border.\"With the meeting yielding little progress, the prospects of Congress passing an assistance package for Ukraine before the year's end have grown dim, particularly after all 49 Senate Republicans blocked a measure to grant aid to Ukraine without immigration restrictions last week. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, a key Republican negotiator on a possible border deal, said that Zelensky's visit had no impact on the current impasse. “Pay attention to us, but not your own country? No,” Lankford told reporters. “We’ve got to be able to deal with all these things together.”Read More: ‘Nobody Believes in Our Victory Like I Do.’ Inside Volodymyr Zelensky’s Struggle to Keep Ukraine in the FightZelensky’s power on Capitol Hill has waned considerably since his last visit one year ago, when he was hailed as a hero during his reception and addressed a joint meeting of Congress before receiving nearly $50 billion in aid. Public support for funding Ukraine’s military effort has fallen considerably since then, and some conservative Republicans are strongly against financing Ukraine's war efforts without politically fraught changes to asylum and other immigration policies.Democrats have conceded to certain Republican requests, such as elevating the criteria for asylum-seekers to establish a credible fear of persecution upon return to their home countries. But they have opposed suggestions to reintroduce Trump-era policies mandating family detention and reinstating a mandate for migrants unable to be detained to wait outside the U.S. for their immigration court hearing. Democrats also resist a proposal to broaden expedited removal proceedings, wherein migrants are deported before having the chance to make asylum claims, on a nationwide scale.Last week, President Joe Biden signaled a willingness to embrace immigration restrictions to secure an agreement, but discussions between the two political parties have proven unsuccessful thus far, and lawmakers have only two more days to reach a resolution before their holiday recess. Biden had been pinning hopes on Zelensky's influence to persuade Congress to pass a $110.5 billion emergency spending bill, including $50 billion in security aid for Ukraine.Senators emerging from Tuesday’s briefing said that Zelensky refrained from engaging in discussions about border security in the U.S., steering clear of involving himself in the domestic policy debate and instead concentrating on the reasons his country needs more aid from the U.S. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said after the meeting that Zelensky warned the fight would devolve into “guerilla warfare” if support for Ukraine eroded. The Ukrainian leader was set to meet with Biden at the White House after his meeting with Senate members and House Speaker Mike Johnson. Johnson, who assumed the role in October, has expressed support for providing assistance to Ukraine, a sentiment echoed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But it’s not clear if the Republican leaders can navigate an aid package through the rightwing faction of their conference. After his one-on-one meeting with Zelensky, Johnson called on the Biden Administration to provide more detail on how the funds to Ukraine would be utilized. \"What the Biden Administration appears to be requesting is billions of additional dollars without proper oversight, lacking a clear winning strategy and devoid of the answers that I believe the American people deserve,” he said. Asked whether Congress can reach an immigration deal and pass the spending package before the end of the year, several Republicans said it was not likely. \"I'm becoming increasingly pessimistic,\" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters.As talks on border security continue, the Biden Administration is warning that the U.S. is on track to deplete its funding for sending weapons and assistance to Ukraine by the end of the year—adding a sense of urgency to the stalled negotiations.\"The one person happiest right now about the gridlock in Congress is Vladimir Putin,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said. “He is delighting in the fact that Donald Trump's border policies are sabotaging military aid to Ukraine.”",

        "title_text": "Japan’s Fumio Kishida Faces Ruling Party’s Biggest Political Scandal in Decades",
        "body_text": "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is struggling to rein in the widest financial scandal to hit his long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party in more than three decades, raising questions about how long he’ll be able to stay in power.  The premier is set to give a news conference at 6:15 p.m. Tokyo time Wednesday, at which he is expected to announce he’s firing four of his cabinet ministers, who are among those accused of concealing income from fundraising events. Prosecutors may start questioning lawmakers as soon as the evening, after the parliamentary session ends, the Yomiuri newspaper said. Read More: Fumio Kishida on Plans for a More Assertive JapanThe extent of alleged involvement by cabinet ministers and senior party officials has invited comparisons with the so-called Recruit affair of the late 1980s, when allegations of insider trading felled then-Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and led to an upper house election defeat. About a fifth of the cabinet is expected to be sacked as the scandal hits the biggest of the five factions in the LDP and appears set to spread even wider. Two party officials are reported to be set to resign. The turmoil also threatens Kishida’s policy program, as he tries to push through measures to shield voters from the effects of inflation and seeks ways to fund his plans for the largest defense expansion since World War II.“This is really a crisis situation,” said Natsuo Yamaguchi, the head of Kishida’s coalition partner party Komeito. “We must clear up the political funding problem with no half measures and then think about how to start over again from fundamentals.”Already the least popular premier in more than a decade according to several polls, Kishida’s support has tumbled further on the scandal. While no general election need be held until 2025, one LDP lawmaker has suggested Kishida could step down as soon as the spring, which would make way for another LDP lawmaker to take over. Read More: Meet the Multi-Ethnic Millennial Who Just Might Represent the Future of Japanese PoliticsA poll published by the Sankei Newspaper and FNN on Monday showed almost 90% of respondents wanted Kishida out by the end of his term in September at the latest. Polling has shown major opposition groups with support rates in the single digits, indicating the LDP would stay in power when the next election is held.The four ministers set to be replaced will include Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, the top government spokesman, as well as trade minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, a key force in Japan’s efforts to revive its semiconductor industry, Kyodo News has reported.  All four are members of the party faction formerly led by late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the largest in the LDP, which has remained leaderless since his assassination more than a year ago. Former Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi is being considered as a replacement for Matsuno, TV Asahi reported, without saying where it got the information. Most lawmakers in the long-ruling LDP are in one of the major factions that for years have acted as parties within the party, raising their own funds and promoting their members for ministerial positions. Koichi Hagiuda, the head of the LDP’s policy research council is set to resign, public broadcaster NHK said Wednesday, in a move that could delay deliberations on next year’s budget. Upper house LDP Secretary General Hiroshige Seko also plans to step down, Jiji Press said. Kishida is also reported to be considering calling off a trip to South America that had been planned for January. “We are unlikely to see major changes in direction despite this scandal,” said Kristi Govella, director of the Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “However, we may see a decrease in Kishida’s ability to focus on foreign policy as his attention is pulled closer to home.”The allegations involve lawmakers who are thought to have failed to declare income from selling tickets to fundraising events, in violation of the campaign financing law.Read More: The Founder of Uniqlo Has a Wake-Up Call for JapanWhile other factions, including Kishida’s own, are facing similar allegations over slush funds, prosecutors are targeting the Abe group because its actions were systematic and involved larger amounts of money, the Yomiuri said on Wednesday. The Abe faction slush fund may amount to as much as 1 billion yen ($6.9 million), the paper said, citing a source close to the matter. Faction lawmakers implicated in the scandal have declined to make substantive comments to address the accusations.The conservative faction has been broadly supportive of Kishida as he upheld Abe’s agenda on key issues like ultra-loose monetary policy and a hawkish defense posture. Making enemies of its 100 or so lawmakers is a risky step. Kishida appears to have backed away from a plan to eject Abe faction members from all levels of government, which was reported by the Asahi newspaper earlier. If Kishida opts to step down, Abe faction lawmakers are likely to be out of the running to replace him, especially given that some members are already seen by voters as tainted by their links to the fringe religious group formerly known as the Unification Church. The party could instead pick a leader without factional ties. Among the public’s most-favored candidates are former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba and outspoken Digital Transformation Minister Taro Kono. Former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is also popular with voters, while Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, while a member of a faction, has been floated as a potential first female leader for the country.

        "title_text": "COP28 Ends With Historic Deal to ‘Transition Away’ From Planet-Warming Fossil Fuels",
        "body_text": "The COP28 climate talks in Dubai ended in a historic deal that committed the world to a transition away from all fossil fuels for the first time.The president of this year’s U.N.-sponsored summit, the UAE’s Sultan Al Jaber, brokered an agreement that was strong enough for the U.S. and European Union on the need to dramatically curb fossil fuel use while keeping Saudi Arabia and other oil producers on board.Read More: What Happens When You Put a Fossil Fuel Exec in Charge of Solving Climate ChangeThe final agreement calls for countries to quickly shift energy systems away from fossil fuels in a just and orderly fashion, qualifications that helped convince the skeptics. Under the deal, countries also are called to contribute to a global transition effort—rather than being outright compelled to make that shift on their own.The so-called “UAE Consensus” concludes the hottest year on record, which led to droughts and devastating wild fires.“Together we have confronted the realities and sent the world in the right direction,” said Al Jaber, who’s also chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. He brought the gavel down to confirm the deal on Wednesday, a day later than scheduled. It was met with applause and cheers by delegates.While the outcome falls short of the specific fossil fuel “phase out” most countries wanted, it does break new ground: No previous COP text has mentioned moving away from oil and gas, the fuels that have underpinned the global economy for decades.How quickly that becomes a reality won’t be decided by the diplomatic horsetrading that clinched today’s deal, but by investors, consumers and national governments. After a pledge to phase down coal in Glasgow two years ago, consumption has continued to rise and the world remains very unlikely to limit warming to the Paris Agreement’s target of 1.5C. This time, the pact leaves room for burning natural gas as part of the transition to clean energy.Sign up for TIME’s “Climate Is Everything Newsletter” here.Still, the Dubai decision is an important marker in the global direction of travel toward a low-carbon energy system. The text also includes agreements to triple the deployment of renewable power and double the rate of efficiency gains by the end of the decade. A separate COP28 agreement, reached at the start of the summit, makes operational a hard-fought fund for addressing the losses and damages of climate change.“An agreement is only as good as its implementation. We are what we do, not what we say,” Al Jaber said. “We must take the steps necessary to turn this agreement into tangible actions.”The COP28 language pushing a decline in fossil fuel use will send a signal to investors about the future of energy markets, said Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s climate envoy, as she was leaving the final plenary meeting at Dubai Expo City.“We now tomorrow move forward in implementing this,” Morgan said. “Every investor should understand now that the future investments that are profitable and long-term are renewable energy—and investing in fossil fuels is a stranded asset.”Investors were also watching for progress on a new carbon offsets market overseen by the United Nations, but talks on that front collapsed after the European Union and some Latin American countries led a push for stricter standards. That means the launch of the program, which governments will be able to use to meet their green pledges, will be delayed.The last-minute deal is a diplomatic win for the UAE and Al Jaber, whose role at Adnoc made him a controversial choice to preside over this year’s talks. There have been hiccups—allegations he used his role to lobby for oil deals and an argument over the science of climate change—but in the end he will argue he delivered.Al Jaber used his presidency to bring the oil and gas industry firmly into the COP process and there were more representatives of fossil fuel companies than at any previous summit, drawing criticism from climate activists.Read More: COP28 Is a Business Bonanza. Should It Be?He forged a pact between more than 50 companies to reduce emissions from their own operations. It said nothing about levels of oil and gas production, but a pledge to reduce pollution from methane—80 times more dangerous than carbon dioxide—to near zero by the end of decade could have a material impact on emissions.That didn’t prevent Saudi Arabia leading a rearguard action against any attempt to include a fossil fuel phase out in the text. As COP28 got into full swing, the kingdom’s Energy Minister was asked by Bloomberg News if he’d be happy to see a phase down in the text.“Absolutely not,” he replied.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries later sent a letter to members, asking them to lobby against any text that targets fossil fuels rather than emissions. While the final language was watered down to reflect their concerns, ultimately the coalition of oil producers was left too isolated to resist.“The much-criticized UAE Presidency has pulled this off,” said Professor Myles Allen, at the University of Oxford. “Everyone seemed ready to write COP28 off just 24 hours ago, you have to hand it to them.”But for small island nations that are already feeling the worst impacts of rising sea levels, the text only took “incremental steps” to phasing out fossil fuels. To a round of applause on the plenary floor, Anne Rasmussen, the lead negotiator for Samoa, warned that the clause on shifting away from fossil fuels focuses exclusively on energy systems, rather than the wider economy.Read More: The Leaders of These Sinking Countries Are Fighting to Stop Climate Change. Here's What the Rest of the World Can LearnShe also complained that the text’s focus on carbon capture and storage is a backward step an could be a license for countries to continue burning hydrocarbons. There’s also a line about transition fuels that many will see as an endorsement for the long-term use of natural gas. “We have come to the conclusion that the course correction that is needed has not yet been secured,” she said.",

        "title_text": "Dengue Fever Is Soaring Worldwide. Here’s What to Know—and How to Stay Protected",
        "body_text": "Governments and public health experts around the world are sounding the alarm about the record-high spread of one of the most notorious—and incurable—diseases, which about half the world is at risk of catching: dengue.The mosquito-borne virus has a long history in warm climates but is now also emerging in regions where it had been generally unheard of—such as in Europe and parts of the U.S. By early December, there had already been more than five million dengue infections worldwide this year—a dramatic increase from some 500,000 cases in 2000—recorded across at least 80 countries and territories. More than 5,500 people have died so far in 2023, according to Save the Children.In October, California announced its first case of locally-transmitted dengue virus. In March, dengue was found in Sudan’s capital Khartoum for the first time in the city’s record, putting its already underfunded healthcare system under serious strain. Meanwhile, in countries where dengue was already endemic, this year has seen the virus spread at an unprecedented scale. Amid the worst outbreak in Bangladesh’s history, dengue cases were reported in all 64 of the country’s districts, and by mid-November the disease had infected 291,832 people and killed 1,476. Peru’s health minister, who in June declared a state of emergency in most parts of the country to deal with a raging dengue outbreak, resigned the same month as infections and deaths continued to mount.A risk assessment report published Tuesday by the Pan-American Health Organization noted that the “lack of robust dengue surveillance and management systems raises concerns about potential undetected cases or unrecorded travel movements that could contribute to unnoticed disease spread.” There is currently no antiviral treatment for dengue, though the symptoms can usually be managed with medicine. Here’s what to know about the disease—and how to keep yourself safe.The symptoms experienced by those infected with dengue can vary widely: up to 80% of dengue cases are asymptomatic, and while some infections may trigger only flu-like symptoms, more serious cases can result in internal bleeding that could lead to death. Some of the more common symptoms of dengue infections include high fever, nausea, vomiting, and severe muscle and joint pain—the latter of which is how the disease earned the nickname “breakbone fever.” When detected early and with access to medical care, the mortality rate of dengue is less than 1%—though that figure rises to 2-5% for severe dengue cases. If left untreated, however, the mortality rate of dengue can reach 20%.Dengue is typically spread through infected female Aedes aegypti (Egyptian tiger) mosquitoes that thrive in stagnant water, passing from one person to another through mosquito bites. The disease can also be transmitted from pregnant women to their babies, and, in rare cases, through blood transfusions, organ transplants, or needle injuries.The disease, which has long been a public health concern in Asia and Latin America, has seen an uptick attributed in part to the resurgence of global travel after the COVID pandemic. This year’s El Niño weather phenomenon, which contributes to warmer temperatures, is also believed to have exacerbated dengue outbreaks in tropical countries.Amid rising global temperatures due to climate change that have made more parts of the world suitable for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to breed, experts are increasingly warning about the threat dengue is set to pose to the southern parts of the U.S. and Europe, as well as new regions in Africa.Researchers have also pointed to the impact of urbanization on dengue transmission. Besides simply increasing population density, the expansion of informal urban settlements with no access to plumbing networks has fostered among stagnant stored water and exposed litter prime breeding and feeding grounds for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are already well-adapted to urban environments.Battling the record surge in dengue cases, health care systems across the world are being tested in unprecedented ways—some buckling under overwhelming demand, as experts raise concerns about the human costs of poor governmental dengue responses. Public anxiety and anger is also mounting: in September, opposition party members in India staged a public protest in Kolkata criticizing the government’s response to dengue.Fumigation remains one of the oldest and most widely used methods to kill mosquitoes around the world. However, mosquito fogging is seeing waning effectiveness. Despite decades of chemical control, researchers warn, dengue outbreaks have intensified as mosquitoes develop resistance to chemical compounds. An innovative effort led by the World Mosquito Program, currently being tested in over a dozen countries, aims to fight mosquito-borne viruses with mosquitoes. Under the program, authorities release special mosquitoes bred to carry a bacteria called Wolbachia, which blocks the transmission of viruses that cause dengue, zika, and yellow fever. However, not all are welcoming of the ambitious plan. When Indonesian authorities announced the release of 200 million Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes in Bali, the plan was met with vehement opposition from both experts and locals, who had little trust in the results of a small-scale pilot study held in another Indonesian city and were worried that Bali residents would be made “lab rats.”Nearby in Singapore, where the Wolbachia project is in full swing, environmental agency personnel conduct regular inspections of homes and other sites to check for potential mosquito breeding grounds and collect water samples for laboratory tests. Owners of premises that are found to have mosquito breeding may be fined or imprisoned. Singapore also tracks dengue clusters emerging in the city-state. A similar initiative is run by Boston Children’s Hospital to track global reports of dengue cases in the media, and researchers in London announced earlier this month the world’s first “dengue dashboard” to model and predict the spread of the disease across the world, which is expected to launch next year. “We need local plans to fight dengue—at village and city level—and with the involvement of communities,” said Yasir Arafat, a health advisor at Save the Children, in a statement spotlighting the danger of this year’s dengue infections. “Funding needs to better anticipate extreme weather and climate shocks to manage the risk and not just the crisis.”With scientists anticipating dengue to reach places that have not been acquainted with the disease, governments around the world have been sharing best practices to prevent the spread of dengue. These include using insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, using insect screens on windows and doors, and performing regular checks in your home for stagnant water. There are currently two dengue vaccines commercially available: Qdenga, which is recommended by the World Health Organization for children aged six to 16 or those living in places with high risk of dengue transmission, and Dengvaxia, which is recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for children aged nine to 16 who have had previous dengue infection. (The world’s first dengue vaccination program, launched in the Philippines in 2016, however, was found to increase the severity of the disease for recipients of Dengvaxia who were later infected with dengue, resulting in decreased confidence in all vaccines in the country.) For those who have been infected with dengue, the WHO recommends drinking plenty of liquids, getting adequate rest, avoiding using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin—instead, opt for paracetamol for pain relief—and seeking medical attention if you experience any severe symptoms.",

        "title_text": "How the West Can Make Russian Sanctions Bite Again",
        "body_text": "Western sanctions against Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 came hard and fast. Moscow lost access to a staggering $300 billion of its foreign exchange reserves held by G7 countries overnight, the ruble sank almost a quarter of its value against the U.S. dollar, and Russia’s industrial base was crippled.Put together by the U.S., E.U., G-7 governments, and others, the sanctions, which started in 2014 after Putin annexed Crimea, were ramped up in 2022. They hit most major Russian banks and included punishing export restrictions on microchips and other key military technologies; sanctions against Putin’s inner circle and Russian oligarchs; and an innovative price cap that penalized Russian oil sales while avoiding a big oil price jump. These sanctions had bite but they are wearing off as Russia adjusts and learns to evade them. The Russian economy has started to grow again, amid ramped up military spending that has reached 10% of GDP, compared with 3-4% before the full-scale invasion. There are a lot of reports of goods, including banned ones, making their way to Russia via third countries (for example, there have been huge jumps in German exports to Kyrgyzstan, with a lot of those products moving swiftly to Russia). And Russia is using a “shadow fleet” of oil tankers and fraudulent bookkeeping to undermine the oil price cap. While the biggest Russian banks have been cut off from the international financial system,  especially the SWIFT clearing mechanism, smaller ones and Gasprombank, the big energy bank, remain in the international SWIFT system. This has weakened the financial pressure. Critics say that sanctions have failed. Some even say that sanctions are useless in any case. As the former U.S. State Department Coordinator for Sanctions, I helped put together the initial ones targeting Russia in 2014. They were significant and what came after 2022 even more so. Just look at the state of Russia’s economy. The IMF still assesses the country’s economic outlook as “dim.” Massive defense spending has artificially jacked up Russian GDP. Capital controls that force Russian firms to sell their hard foreign currency to the state have inflated the value of an otherwise weak ruble. Yet these dramatic measures cannot fully make up for the impact of economic pressure. The West can also tighten the screws by intensifying sanctions and enforcement. With Ukraine’s stalling counteroffensive, this is the time to lean into economic pressure on Russia, not let up. Read More: Inside Volodymyr Zelensky’s Struggle to Keep Ukraine in the FightThe U.S. and Europe have plenty of options to do this. They can toughen export controls on niche technologies that Russia needs for its war-footing. They can close gaps in the oil price cap by going after Russia’s “ghost fleet” of tankers and oil brokers that falsify invoices to skirt the restrictions. They can take the $300 or so billion in frozen Russian assets and use them to help Ukraine—a bit of poetic justice that U.S. and European taxpayers might appreciate. They can extend the financial sanctions to all Russian banks (with exemptions for food, medicine, and non-military transactions) to deepen Russia’s isolation. They can clamp down on exports to places like Kyrgyzstan that are actually bound for Russia. The U.S., E.U., and the U.K. are already taking some of these steps and Washington announced new sanctions on Dec. 12. They can do more.In the short-term, advancing economic pressure on Russia can show that Putin cannot, as he hopes, wait out the West and grind Ukraine into submission. As the West learned during the Cold War, economic pressure can work.After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the imposition of martial law in Poland in the early 1980s to crush the country’s democratic movement, the U.S. tried to impose economic pressure on the USSR. Those efforts were seen at the time as inconsistent, contentious, and a failure. In retrospect, we see that they worked: they deprived the Soviet economy of key injections of Western investment and technology. In the 1980s, the Soviet economy sputtered and sank. In a few years more, the Soviet empire collapsed. The Putinist economy is similarly rigid, with little room for entrepreneurship amid the top-to-bottom corruption and cronyism. Russia’s massive military expenses and lack of investment will increase pressure on Russia’s economy by starving the rest of the economy of resources, just as happened with the Soviet economy.

        "body_text": "South Korea expects its record-low fertility rate to plumb new depths annually for a few more years, worsening its demographic challenges.The number of babies expected per woman probably dropped this year to 0.72 and will continue to fall through 2025, when it’s expected to reach 0.65, the statistical office said Thursday in its latest population forecasts. South Korea already has the world’s lowest fertility rate at 0.78 as of 2022.Read More: South Korea Muses a New Military Exemption: Serve Your Country By Having More KidsThe projections paint a darker picture of demographic trends for South Korea than they did two years ago, when authorities forecast that the fertility rate would bottom out at 0.7 in 2024 before rising again.Low fertility threatens to undermine South Korea’s economic future by shrinking its workforce and slowing consumption. It also casts a long shadow over national security by reducing the pool of men available to join the military to counter threats from North Korea.Earlier this month, finance minister nominee Choi Sang-mok likened the dangers of South Korea’s demographics to the iceberg that sank the Titanic, saying it’s already too late to reverse the trend simply via fertility rates.Read More: Why China Needs to Learn to Live With Its Low Fertility RateSo far the government has focused on birthrates. Measures introduced to encourage more births include a tripling of monthly allowances and a reduction of mortgage interest rates for parents. Policymakers are now looking for ways to cope with the aging society, coming to grips with the reality that it would take decades to reverse the demographic trend.The latest forecast by Statistics Korea puts the population in 2072 at 36.2 million, a 30% decline from the current 51.7 million, even though the fertility rate may recover a bit to 0.68 in 2026. The population is expected to fall every year starting in 2025.A variety of factors are blamed for Koreans’ reluctance to have kids, ranging from the high costs of housing to the competitive environment for children’s education. Increasing gender tensions are another reason regularly highlighted.Read More: Infanticide in South Korea: What to Know",

        "title_text": "Once Labeled Australia’s Worst Female Serial Killer, Mother’s Murder Convictions Overturned",
        "body_text": "Kathleen Folbigg, once described by Australian media as the country’s “worst female serial killer” and “most hated woman,” wept to applause in a courtroom on Thursday upon the overturning of her two-decade-old convictions over the deaths of her own children, thanks to seemingly exonerating scientific evidence.“For almost a quarter of a century, I faced disbelief and hostility. I suffered abuse in all its forms. I hoped and prayed that one day I would be able to stand here with my name cleared,” Folbigg told reporters outside the court. “I am grateful that updated science and genetics have given me answers of how my children died.”Folbigg’s four young children died one after another between 1989 and 1999. Caleb, her first child, died suddenly at 19 days old in 1989; her second child Patrick died in 1991 at 8 months old; her third child Sarah died in 1993 at 10 months old; and her fourth child Laura was 19 months old when she died in 1999. Folbigg, who was charged with smothering them, was convicted of three counts of murder and one of manslaughter in 2003 in a highly-publicized trial that relied largely on her husband’s accusations and her own diary entries that expressed guilt over her children’s successive deaths. She was sentenced to 40 years in prison, which was later reduced to 30.Read More: South Korea’s Infanticide Problem Highlights Wider Population StrugglesFolbigg long maintained her innocence, but it wasn’t until 2011, when law professor Emma Cunliffe wrote a book titled Murder, Medicine and Motherhood, that the wider public began to raise questions about the conviction. In 2018, new evidence was found that Folbigg’s two daughters carried a rare genetic variant that could have led to their deaths, in addition to expert testimony that Laura could have died from myocarditis, a heart inflammation that is also known to result in sudden death. Researchers also found that her sons had a different genetic mutation linked to sudden-onset epilepsy in mice. The new evidence left many scientists convinced that Folbigg’s children died from natural causes, as she had claimed, rather than as a result of being smothered by Folbigg as prosecutors had argued. As doubts grew around the case, some believed that Folbigg suffered one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in Australia’s history. Among those who petitioned for an inquiry to be held were prominent figures in the scientific community, including John Shine, president of the Australian Academy of Science, Australian immunologist and Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, and Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn. A government inquiry held in 2022 and made public in November recommended that the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal consider clearing her convictions. In addition to summarizing the evidence of other possible causes of death, the report also included expert testimony that suggested none of the four children’s autopsies showed any “signs of smothering.”The chief justice leading Folbigg’s inquiry said in a press release that he could clearly conclude “there was reasonable doubt” as to Folbigg’s guilt for every offense that she had been convicted of.In June, 56-year-old Folbigg was pardoned by New South Wales Governor Margaret Beazley and released from prison, where she had endured a beating by a fellow inmate in 2021.Read More: Innocent, After Proven GuiltyFolbigg was originally arrested in 2001, two years after her now ex-husband Craig discovered her diary and became convinced that she had killed their children. During her trial, in which he testified against her, he was accused by the defense of lying to police and fabricating evidence to make his wife look sinister. He has since refused to provide a sample of his DNA to assist the inquiry into her conviction and has called for a retrial. Folbigg’s case bears resemblance to others where mothers were wrongfully convicted of murder after their children’s sudden deaths. In 2002, Angela Cannings was sentenced to jail for killing her two children and released 18 months later after trial evidence was discredited. In 2003, British lawyer Sally Clark was released after serving three years of a life sentence for the conviction of murdering her two sons, who were later found to have likely died of natural causes. Clark was found dead at her home in 2007, with her family saying that she “never fully recovered” from the criminal ordeal.“The system preferred to blame me rather than accept that sometimes children can and do die suddenly and unexpectedly and heartbreakingly,” Folbigg said outside the court on Thursday.Rhanee Rego, Folbigg’s lawyer, said that they would demand “substantial” compensation from the state government for her time in prison. It’s unclear how much she could receive, though Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who was convicted of murdering her daughter in 1982 and exonerated six years later after it was found that the baby had been taken by a dingo like she had initially claimed, received A$1.3 million ($872,000) in compensation from the Australian government in 1992.Read More: Why That 'Dingo's Got My Baby' Line Isn't FunnyFolbigg wrote in 2006 of her search for justice and about how she would feel when the truth is finally uncovered: “That day I shall not gloat, or say, ‘I told you so.’ I’ll simply cry and keep crying all the tears that are due to me.”",

        "title_text": "U.K. Lawmaker Scott Benton Faces Parliament Suspension Over “Serious Breach” of Rules",
        "body_text": "U.K. Member of Parliament Scott Benton is facing a suspension ban after a damning report accused him of “an extremely serious breach” of government ethics rules, causing further strife for beleaguered Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The House of Commons Committee on Standards report, published on Dec. 14, concluded that Benton, MP for Blackpool South, made statements to the effect that he would be willing to breach House lobbying rules in a meeting with undercover Times of London reporters. The message he sent to the fictitious investors was that “he was corrupt” and “for sale,” the report said. “He communicated a toxic message about standards in Parliament. We condemn Mr. Benton for his comments which unjustifiably tarnish the reputation of all MPs.” In a letter to the committee about its findings, Benton denied breaking any parliamentary rules and said “it is my view that I complied with the letter and the spirit of the rules.” The dilemma dates back to March when Benton met with undercover Times reporters posing as representatives of a fictitious company looking to get involved with U.K. betting and offered him a possible income opportunity, the report said. At the time, Benton was head of a parliamentary group on gambling. During the meeting, Benton made statements to the effect that he had breached House rules, would be willing to do so in return for payment and other MPs had done the same, the report said. Benton denied these allegations in written responses to the committee. After the articles were published, Benton referred himself for the House standards review. The report recommended that Benton be suspended from Parliament for 35 days, \"with concomitant loss of salary.\"If MPs move forward with this, it would trigger a recall petition, meaning that it would be up to Benton’s constituents to decide whether to hold a by-election. The Tory party suspended Benton in April following the Times articles. The scandal poses yet another challenge for Sunak, whose approval ratings have dropped as his party faces criticism following its pandemic response, a cost-of-living crisis and the so-far failed plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda to deter undocumented migration that he’s still trying to push through Parliament. The Tories are facing another potential by-election in Wellingborough next year, after former MP Peter Bone was suspended for bullying and sexual misconduct allegations. Bone denied the allegations and appealed the findings of an independent expert report. The recall petition to decide whether to run an election for his seat closes Dec. 19. The party already lost two by-elections that flipped seats to Labour in October, signaling trouble as the ruling party prepares to call a general election next year. ",

        "body_text": "Christmas traditions vary vastly across the globe. In Latin America, residents typically celebrate the holiday on the night of Dec. 24th, which they call “Nochebuena.” In Japan, some families flock to KFC for their holiday dinner. But in the royal family, Christmas tradition keeps couples apart for the first part of their day.According to U.K. reports, Prince William and Kate eat their breakfast separately on Christmas morning. Read More: U.K. Politician Faces Suspension Over “Serious Breach” of RulesFormer royal chef Darren McGrady—who was the personal chef to Queen Elizabeth II, and other royal family members, for fifteen years—told the Mirror that women typically eat breakfast in their room, while men meet in the dining room for a meal two hours before they head to mass at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, Norfolk, England. The tradition affects all royal couples, as men and women only gather together for lunch when they return from an 11 a.m. service on the 25th. McGrady previously told the Daily Mail in 2017 that women opt for a lighter breakfast of fruit and toast while men eat a fuller meal with eggs, bacon, mushroom, kippers, and more. It is not clear why Christmas tradition keeps the couple apart, or indeed if William and Kate abide by this rule every year. Other royal traditions seem to date back to the family’s German roots. For instance, Prince Harry confirmed in his book, Spare, that his family exchanges gifts on Christmas Eve. The royal family’s official website says that members usually lay out their gifts on trestle tables and exchange them around teatime. Christmas trees also became a tradition in royal households after they were popularized by Queen Victoria, King Charles’ great-great-great-grandmother, in the nineteenth century. Trees were previously donated by the royal family to churches and schools in the Sandringham area, as well as St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, St. Giles’ Cathedral, and more. Additionally, royal family members typically send out Christmas cards to family, friends, and members of the family—though some government officials may also receive one. Current tallies have not been updated recently, but under Queen Elizabeth II’s reign, the royal family sent out about 750 Christmas cards annually.  \"Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year,” the 2023 Christmas card from King Charles read. ",

        "title_text": "Calling Out Terrorism Shouldn’t Be an Issue of Free Speech",
        "body_text": "Nowadays, you can determine the extent of free speech on American campuses by whether armed police are required both to protect an invited guest lecturer and to ensure that the event is not shut down by protestors. That, at least, was my conclusion when I spoke last month at a university in the Midwest and another in the Northeast.Let me explain. The title of my lecture was “How the October 7th, 2023 Attacks Have Changed Everything: Lessons from Terrorism for Counterterrorism.” I suspect it was the use of the word “terrorism” in the title that incurred the ire of the protestors even before I uttered a sound.Some people simply don’t want to hear that Hamas is a terrorist group, despite the fact that Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Paraguay, the European Union, and has been outlawed by Jordan since 1999. The words “terrorist” or “terrorism” remain conspicuous for their absence in virtually all mainstream media reports of the October 7th attacks outside of Israel. Both the Associated Press and BBC in fact specifically prohibit any use of those two words. Nor are they alone. Even the U.S. government’s own Voice of America imparts guidance to its journalists that permits the events of October 7th to be described as “terrorist attacks or acts of terror,” but enjoins from “calling Hamas and its members terrorists.”Instead, a myriad of euphemisms are enlisted, including “militants,” “combatants,” “fighters,” “infiltrators,” “gunmen,” and so on. The New York Times print headline on October 8th says it all: “Palestinian Militants Stage Attack On Israel.” The accompanying article reported rockets fired indiscriminately from Gaza on Israeli civilian targets; the wholesale killings of Israelis at both a music festival and in agricultural and residential communities along the border; as well as the abduction of men, women, children, babies, the elderly, the infirm, and the disabled, who were taken hostage and forcibly transported to Gaza.Read More: It’s Not Easy to Be Jewish on American Campuses TodayEach of those violent acts is incontestably terrorism—and, to use another term frequently heard nowadays, are war crimes. Yet, the pervasive absence of this word fosters a moral as well as a rhetorical ambiguity where Hamas apologists can facilely claim that the perpetrators of this wanton violence are “freedom-fighters,” “resistance-fighters” or “martyr heroes.” Those terms have become the preferred nomenclature on America campuses as well—where even a word such as “insurgent” is shunned as too pejorative and insufficiently genuflective.All this is a reflection of what a colleague at Georgetown University calls the POCOFO phenomenon: the “post-colonial, post-Foucault” (named after the influential French philosopher, Michael Foucault) trend that now dominates university pedagogy. The POCOFO orthodoxy holds that “settler-colonialist” perspectives must be banished from curricula and campuses. Accordingly, arguments articulating Western and northern hemisphere perspectives while neglecting southern hemispheric grievances are to be denigrated as racist, supremacist, inequitable, dis-empowering, patriarchal, and thus prohibited.Conversely, at neither campus I spoke at did the protestors seek to engage in dialogue and discussion, to question my arguments or debate their implications. Instead, at one event, they silently waved hands dipped in red paint and departed before the question-and-answer part of the program began. Having made their point and fulfilled their performative purpose, they saw no reason for any further engagement. At the other campus, however, the protestors’ purpose was indeed disruption and denial—upending the event and preventing my lecture and any meaningful exchange of ideas. Instead, these students, hurled invectives—accusing me of being a “war criminal” and “war profiteer”—before breaking into “river to the sea” and “free Palestine” chants. It took the police about 10 minutes to remove the dozen or so protestors who clearly had no interest in discussion, debate, or dialogue.In a recent opinion piece, Wall Street Journal columnist Gerard Baker observed how Vladimir Lenin has replaced Voltaire on American campuses. “I disagree with what you say, and I will do all I can to prevent you from saying it,” is the new approach to learning, he argued—just as I discovered. Along these same lines, Harvard professor Danielle Allen presciently underscored the dangers this poses to not just to our universities but to our country. “A culture of intimidation is,” she explained, “the very opposite of a culture of mutual respect necessary for learning and, for that matter, a healthy democracy.” In this respect, what should worry us most is our universities’ preeminent role in educating persons today who will go on to be future heads of state, key policy and decision-makers, influential columnists, and captains of industry but who now appear content to stifle free speech and open discussion of contentious issues simply to signal their opprobrium.It is a sad commentary about emotional responses, vituperation, closed minds, and the collective failure of professors and administrators alike for allowing this climate to emerge and lay waste to the free and open exchange of ideas—the bedrock of the academy’s values and mission. Diversity on campus must not just be predicated on identity but also on ideas. America’s universities must live up to these ideals.",

        "title_text": "Prince Harry Wins Partial Victory in Hacking Case Against U.K. Newspaper Group",
        "body_text": "Prince Harry received a ruling in his favor in a landmark case accusing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) of unlawfully gathering information, a watershed victory that could potentially pave the way for other lawsuits against the press. Judge Timothy Fancourt said in London's High Court Friday morning that he found proof of \"extensive\" hacking and the “habitual” use of private investigators to obtain private information, such as medical records or banking details, by deception and illegal searches.Read More: U.K. Politician Faces Suspension Over “Serious Breach” of RulesHarry sued the newspaper group, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People, over 33 articles dated between 1996 and 2009 that he said were obtained using unlawful means. The judge ruled that 15 out of the 33 articles were the product of phone hacking or other unlawful means. Judge Fancourt says the hacking happened to a \"modest extent\" between 2003 and 2009.Prince Harry has been awarded £140,600 ($179,763) in damages, as the judge ruled that newspaper directors \"turned a blind eye and positively concealed\" unlawful gathering of information.Following the ruling, Harry's lawyer David Sherborne read a statement from the royal, who was not present, outside London’s Royal Courts of Justice. “This case is not just about hacking, it’s about a systemic practice of unlawful and appalling behavior, followed by cover-ups and destruction of evidence, the shocking scale of which can only be revealed through these proceedings,” Harry said in the statement. “The court has found that Mirror Group’s principal board of directors, their legal department, senior executives and editors such as Piers Morgan clearly knew about or were involved in these illegal activities.” Morgan, in a statement to reporters outside his London home on Friday afternoon, denied knowledge of unlawfully obtaining information, saying he has “never hacked a phone or told anyone else to hack a phone.” He said that in all the cases reviewed by the judge, there was just one article flagged which was published under his time as editor at The Mirror, whereby the contents may have been gathered unlawfully. Morgan said he had zero knowledge of how the information was gathered and that the claims were made by “old foes” with “an ax to grind.” The long-time journalist also accused Prince Harry of being on a mission “to destroy the British monarchy.” Harry said in his statement that these executives then lied under oath during the Leveson Inquiry, a judicial inspection into industry phone hacking. Harry urged financial regulators, the stock market and the Metropolitan Police to investigate bringing charges against the company and those who he said have broken the law.  “I hope that the court’s finding will serve as a warning to all media organizations who have employed these practices and then similarly lied about it,” Harry said. “My commitment to seeing this case through is based on my belief in our need and collective right to a free and honest press,” he continued, adding that “the mission continues.” Harry gave testimony and extensive evidence in court in June, the first senior royal in modern times to do so, claiming the newspaper group’s management was aware of and approved of the actions. MGN issued a statement after the ruling Friday: “We welcome today’s judgment that gives the business the necessary clarity to move forward from events that took place many years ago. Where historical wrongdoings took place, we apologize unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation.” Harry’s case was picked as one of four tests out of those filed by around 100 plaintiffs, including celebrities, who sued over allegations of phone-hacking and unlawful information-gathering between 1991 and 2011. The ruling could pave the way for lawsuits by other plaintiffs and Harry’s other ongoing cases to continue. Harry has also sued News Corp's U.K. operation, News Group Newspapers (NGN), which publishes The Sun tabloid, and Associated Newspapers (ANL), publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. In another of the cases, filed by Coronation Street actor Michael Turner, known professionally as Michael Le Vell, the judge ruled Friday that four articles out of 27 were due to hacking and awarded him £31,650 pounds ($40,453) in damages. The claims of the two other plaintiffs, Fiona Wightman, the ex-wife of U.K. comedian Paul Whitehouse, and Nikki Sanderson, another Coronation Street actor, were dismissed on limitation grounds, the judge ruled. Harry has been critical of the British tabloid press, especially in relation to the treatment of his mother Princess Diana and her death after a car crash in a Paris tunnel during a paparazzi chase in 1997. Harry’s relationship with the press has been documented in his Netflix series Harry & Meghan and his 2022 autobiography Spare.The prince and his wife Meghan Markle stepped back from royal duties and moved to California in 2020.",

        "title_text": "Volume of Migrants Crossing the Dangerous Darién Gap Hit Record High in 2023",
        "body_text": "An unprecedented half a million people migrated north across the Darién Gap, a dangerous stretch of jungle between Colombia and Panama, this year—more than double the number last year—in a sign of an escalating humanitarian crisis, the U.N. recently reported.Laurent Duvillier, UNICEF’s spokesperson for Latin America and the Caribbean based in Panama, tells TIME that many—driven to leave their homes by poverty, crime, or discrimination—aim to seek asylum in the U.S. or Canada, though they may never get there. This analysis is supported by refugee protection organization HIAS, with a spokesperson telling TIME that, by the group’s estimations, between 90 to 95% of those crossing the Darién Gap aim to reach the U.S.Nearly one in four people who made the treacherous journey across the Darién in 2023 were children, the U.N. said. As of Friday, 84 children died or went missing while migrating across Latin America and the Caribbean this year, the International Organization for Migration said. The spike has alarmed aid groups, who say the stats underscore dire conditions in the countries people are leaving. “We’ve never seen this before,” Duvillier tells TIME in a phone call. “It’s just unprecedented, and it’s going to continue.”The journey on foot through the roadless jungle, across rain-swollen rivers and thick foliage, takes seven to 10 days, Duvillier says, adding that coyotes, human smugglers who charge migrants for their passage, deceive their customers that the journey is easy.Often, children arrive at UNICEF’s support centers dehydrated, with infectious diseases and skin rashes, Duvillier says. Some minors show up alone, separated from their parents on the journey and vulnerable to exploitation and child labor, and UNICEF tries to reunite them with their families. “When they arrive in Panama, they have very little left but the clothes that they’re wearing,” Duvillier says. “You can see on their faces, they are survivors.”    Adults are also at risk of violence, robbery, human trafficking, extortion, and kidnapping by criminal gangs, the U.N. said. Many are LGBTQ or domestic-abuse survivors, HIAS said in September. One in four people they served traveled with survivors of physical, psychological, or sexual violence, and 23% reported abuse on the journey.  Most migrants crossing the Darién are from Venezuela, Haiti, Ecuador, and other Central and South American countries, but some are from as far as sub-saharan Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the U.N. said. Migration north has spiked for multiple reasons, experts say. In Ecuador, expanding criminal gang activity has pushed entire families to leave. Protests and violence have rocked Haiti, where more than 50% of the population lives under the poverty line. In Venezuela, inflation has skyrocketed. Additionally, climate change has strengthened hurricanes and broadened their impact inland, pushing more people to leave, Duvillier says: “When you lose everything, you have no reason to stay.” The surge across the Darién Gap has been reflected in an influx at the U.S. border and, eventually, in metropolises like New York City. Mayor Eric Adams visited the Darién Gap in October to discourage further migrants from making the trip.U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 2.4 million apprehensions along its southwest land border this past fiscal year. Monthly crossings hit a high in September with more than 269,000, but dipped down to 240,988 in October.The U.S. government reverted back to pre-pandemic rules, with some new stricter regulations, for people seeking asylum who crossed the border illegally in May, and the Department of Homeland Security reported it had removed or returned 355,000 individuals between then and October. Amid high unlawful border crossings, President Joe Biden is now trying to pass a bill that includes both border security funding and a military aid package for Ukraine and Israel. Republicans have pushed for border policy changes, including stricter security measures, in exchange for approving billions for Ukraine, putting pressure on Biden to negotiate. The Biden Administration has blamed Congress for not passing comprehensive immigration reform, and said in September it’s doing its best using “limited tools.” That included adding military personnel to the border, expanding detention facilities, speeding up deportations, accelerating work authorization for asylum seekers and extending temporary protection for some.In October, the administration moved forward with building another section of border wall in Texas. During a White House meeting with the press, Biden told reporters that the funding for this was previously appropriated, noting that he had tried to get Congress to redirect that money. When asked if he believes a border wall works, Biden replied \"No.\"TIME reached out to the Department of Homeland Security to ask if the Biden Administration has any comment regarding the U.N.'s report about the high numbers making the Darién Gap crossing, and if there are any plans in place regarding the situation.In response, a department spokesperson tells TIME: “The Biden-Harris Administration has led the largest expansion of lawful pathways in decades, while continuing to enforce consequences for those who do not use these pathways to come to the United States. We continue to work closely with international partners throughout the region, including the Governments of Colombia and Panama, to address the humanitarian emergency happening in the Darién, and we are targeting the smuggling networks that prey on vulnerable migrants.”“We know what approach works—expanding lawful pathways and delivering consequences for those who do not use them. We ask Congress to pass the supplemental funding request, which will significantly enhance our ability to secure the border and expand legal avenues for migration from the region.”The International Organization for Migration and UNHCR have urged that a comprehensive regional approach is needed to address the “failing” global immigration system. The heads of the two organizations criticized governments that have cracked down on asylum seekers, arguing doing so often violates human rights and leads to riskier migration in an editorial for TIME.Instead, the world must invest in development to address the reasons people are leaving their homes, support countries along migration routes who host a disproportionate number of asylum seekers, and expand legal migration options in wealthy destination countries to prevent more dangerous, criminal alternatives, the agencies argued. Duvillier says migrants, especially children, must be protected, and transit countries should integrate migrants by issuing them documentation, arguing that failing to do so can push people into criminality.“It’s not one country fixing it,” Duvillier says. “It’s the entire region that needs to turn what is often misperceived as a threat into an opportunity for growth and political and social stability.”",

        "title_text": "What Palestinian Children Face in Israeli Prisons",
        "body_text": "With conflict in Gaza entering its third month—and instances of violence spilling over into the West Bank—the harrowing reality of Israel’s systematic detention of Palestinian children has been thrust into the spotlight. The extent of the issue was made clear during the seven-day ceasefire between Nov. 24 to Nov. 30 which saw 105 hostages held by Hamas—both Israelis and foreign nationals—released in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and children. The deal, which was brokered by Qatar and Egypt and took place across six exchanges, raised questions about why so many children were being held in Israeli prisons. The reality is that the most common charge against children is throwing stones. An estimated 10,000 Palestinian children have been held in military detention over the past 20 years, with Save the Children noting that they are “the only children in the world who are systematically prosecuted in military courts.” As of Nov. 20, Israeli forces had arrested as many as 880 Palestinian children this year, a practice made possible under Israel’s draconian military laws.The youngest child who was released by Israeli authorities during the ceasefire was Ahmad Salayme, a 14-year-old boy. Salayme was arrested in May for throwing stones in a Jewish settlement in occupied East Jerusalem. (Settlements are considered illegal under international law.)Read More: Palestinian Journalists Offer a Rare Glimpse Into Life in Gaza. But for How Long?Salayme’s family had not spoken to him since days before Hamas attacked festival goers in Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing over 240 hostages. Since then, Israel’s bombardment of the Palestinian enclave has killed at least 18,205 and displaced over 85% of its population, according to UNRWA figures released Dec. 13. As a result, many families have been left wondering if their loved ones survived the aggression. Despite their time apart, Salayme’s family was ordered by Israeli forces not to celebrate their reunion: “They told me no celebrations, and on the day of my release I’m not allowed to leave my house, raise any signs or banners, use a megaphone,” he told Al Jazeera upon his release on Tuesday. “And if I break any of these rules I will be taken back.”Dozens of Palestinians who were released during a 2011 Israel-Hamas prisoner exchange were arrested again by 2014 and their sentences were reinstated. As such, the re-arrest of previously jailed children is highly likely, Brad Parker, an attorney and Senior Policy Adviser at Defense for Children International—Palestine, tells TIME. DCIP is an independent organization that provides detained Palestinian children with legal assistance. Parker says that whether included in the swap or not, many children face the threat of re-arrest because they are earmarked as a previous offender with suspended sentences, restricted freedom of movement, and decreased chance of being granted travel permits.  “It’s not a situation where there is any recourse,” says Parker. “From the Israeli authorities, it’s a gift and it can be rescinded. That’s what we’ve seen in the past.” Human rights groups have long criticized the workings of Israel’s military law, a legal framework that is selectively applied to Palestinians living in occupied territories, while Israeli settlers hold increased rights under civil law. Save the Children reported that 86 percent of children are beaten in Israeli detention, while 69 percent are strip-searched and 42 percent are subject to injuries during their arrests. Meanwhile, counterparts in Israeli settlements can expect a phone call or summons for questioning by police, which will typically take place in daylight hours with parents or guardians present at the station. Israeli children are also very likely to be granted bail. In 2015, Human Rights Watch found that Israeli military courts in the West Bank denied bail to Palestinian children in 72 percent of cases, while civil courts denied bail to Israealis in 17.9 percent of cases.“Under Israeli military law... throwing stones and objects is a specific offense under the military law,” says Parker, noting that this is the most common charge. He adds that this legislation empowers Israeli authorities to detain and prosecute any person over the age of 12 in the military court. “It has less to do with kids throwing stones or not, and much more to do with targeting children and specific villages to facilitate the ultimate sort of goal of occupation, which is controlling a civilian population,” Parker adds. Many Palestinian children are arrested during night raids and some are held in administrative detention, without trial or sentence. Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights says there are “myriad serious human rights concerns” about these practices. “These include the prevalence of traumatic night-time arrests raids against children in their family home; children being painfully hand-tied, blindfolded, transferred to detention on the floor of a military vehicle, and subjected to physical and verbal abuse by Israeli soldiers,” LPHR’s director and principal lawyer Tareq Shrourou tells TIME. He adds that these systematic violations are in violation of the U.N. Conventions on the Rights of the Child, as ratified by Israel in 1991.Read More: I Saw the Haunting Reality of Palestinian Child PrisonersThe most severe example is the case of Ahmad Manasra, who was 13 when he was arrested in connection to the stabbing of two Israeli citizens in occupied East Jerusalem in 2015. Israeli courts found that Manasra did not participate in the stabbings, according to Amnesty International, but he has since been serving a nine-and-a-half-year sentence for attempted murder. Ahmad’s cousin Hassan, 15, was shot dead at the scene.At the time of his arrest, Manasra was hit by a car and bleeding from injuries when officers interrogated him without parents or lawyers present. Videos of Manasra’s distressing interrogation have received viral attention since November’s prisoner exchange began, with many calling for him to be among those released. Manasra has since developed schizophrenia and mental health issues, as well as diminishing eyesight as a result of being kept in a small solitary confinement cell for 23 hours a day. While DCIP’s Parker says Manasra is an extreme case, he maintains that the mistreatment of children in custody is prevalent and well-documented. Another concern is the military court’s disproportionately high conviction rate of over 99%, which Shrourou attributes to “coercively obtained” confessions during interrogation. Only after the interrogation—without parent, legal counsel, or official audio-visual recordings—is a child granted access to a lawyer through private means or charities such as DCIP. “All the kids plead guilty because it's the fastest way to get them out of that custodial detention setting. It's not a court that's interested in justice,” says Parker. “If they do challenge a charge, they could essentially be held indefinitely to the end of legal proceedings.” Parker says that the prison service can deny child prisoners access to a phone and visitation at will. In prison, Parker says children are held in multiperson cells with two or three bunks with other young people. “There's not a corresponding educational curriculum. They take some classes, depending on what's offered in the individual prisons, but it doesn't correspond at all with the policy and curriculum,” says Parker. Often children can fail to reintegrate in schools and with their families, while many suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder from serious maltreatment in detention.Read More: With the Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Over, Agony Continues for Hostage FamiliesShrourou identifies this mistreatment as physical, psychological, and emotional abuse. Some Palestinians who were released in the swap said that they were subjected to collective punishment as a result of Hamas’ attacks. Testimonies from released prisoners say guards confiscated bedding, loathing, and utensils on top of insidious violence.   18-year-old Mohammed Nazal told the BBC he was beaten by Israeli guards and sustained injury to his hands while sheltering his head. \"At first I was in a lot of pain,\" Nazal said. \"After a while I knew they were broken, so I stopped using them. I only used my hands when I went to the toilet,\" he added, noting that other inmates helped him to carry out tasks because he was too scared to approach the guards. Israel’s prison service denies Nazal’s claims are true and claims he was checked by medical professionals before his release, which Nazal has disputed.  Zeina Abdo is an 18-year-old who was freed in November’s swap. After spending eight months on house arrest, Abdo was summoned for imprisonment for five and a half months on charges of \"incitement on social media.\" Upon release, Abdo recalls guards attacking teenage prisoners with tear gas four times after the Oct. 7 attacks. “They beat the girls and assaulted all the girls,” she told Al Jazeera. “We’re young girls. We are kids. How do you come and beat us?”",

        "title_text": "Al Jazeera Journalist Whose Family Was Killed in Airstrike Is Wounded in Gaza. Another Has Died",
        "body_text": "One Al Jazeera journalist has died and another is wounded after what is believed was an Israeli missile attack at a school in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Friday.Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh was injured, but Al Jazeera confirmed the death of cameraperson Samer Abudaqa. Dahdouh, whose wife, son, daughter and grandson were killed in an airstrike in October, was wounded by shrapnel in his upper arm and rushed to receive medical care at Nasser Hospital.Around 6:30 p.m. local time, an ambulance was dispatched for Abudaqa after it received approval from Israeli forces, but it had to turn back because rubble blocked the road, the news outlet reported. Arrangements were being made to get a bulldozer to clear the path as of 7:30 p.m., but by the time medical teams got to him, he had died. Abudaqa was the father of four children and was a resident of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis. Dahdouh, who returned to broadcasting on Saturday, with bandages on his arm and hand, said that he and Abudawa were with civil defense rescuers who were working to evacuate a family after their house was bombed when Dahdouh heard an explosion that knocked him out. Three civil defense team members were also killed at the school, according to the Palestinian Interior Ministry. Ramy Budair, a journalist with the Palestinian New Press agency, was also killed. In a Friday afternoon press release, the Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “deeply saddened” by the news and called “on international authorities to conduct an independent investigation into the attack to hold the perpetrators to account.”In an emailed response to TIME, the Israel Defense Forces said that it “takes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists. The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists. Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks. The IDF will continue to counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians.”On Oct. 25, Dahdouh received the news while on air that his immediate family was killed when the home they were sheltering in was hit by an airstrike. He returned to work just days later.Attacks on another journalist were also reported on Friday by the Times of Israel. Video footage shows border police officers beating Palestinian photojournalist Mustafa Haruf with his gun in East Jerusalem. Haruf was then continuously kicked in his head and body and is heard crying out in pain. Haruf says that he was attacked after leaving a prayer protest in Wadi Joz, which Israeli forces later separated. Border police said that it suspended the officers seen beating Haruf in the video, and is opening an investigation into the attack, the Times of Israel adds. An earlier statement by police indicated that journalists in the area refused to evacuate. Friday’s incident underscored the war's deadly toll on Gazan journalists, who are striving to survive the same dangers and deprivations they’re covering. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage, Israeli’s airstrike campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 18,000 people, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Read More: Palestinian Journalists Offer a Rare Glimpse Into Life in Gaza. But for How Long?At least 63 journalists and media workers have also died as of Dec. 15, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported. The grim tally includes the deadliest month for journalist deaths in a conflict since the organization began gathering data in 1992.Nonprofits have pushed for more protections for the press. The International Federation of Journalists said it was “deeply shocked” to hear about Friday’s injuries. “We condemn the attack and reiterate our demand that journalists’ lives must be safeguarded,” it said in a post on X.  In one of the first press deaths of the war, a Reuters video journalist was killed in Lebanon on Oct. 13. A Reporters Without Borders investigation claimed the journalists’ vehicle, with its clear press marking, was targeted. The IDF told TIME on Nov. 4 that the incident was under review. The day before the journalist's death, they had requested that the U.N.'s peacekeeping force verify there were no civilians in the combat zone. They added that entering combat zones “creates a real and immediate danger to civilian lives.\" On that day, the IDF used tank and artillery fire in response to a missile that hit Israel's security fence, the statement said.Other journalists from Al Jazeera, whose headquarters are in Qatar, have been injured or killed previously while covering Israel-Palestinian conflict. Last year, a U.N. body determined that Israeli forces shot and killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank, not indiscriminate firing by armed Palestinians as initially claimed by Israeli authorities, the international agency said.

        "title_text": "The Attacks From Yemen’s Houthi Rebels in the Red Sea Are Having a Significant Global Impact",
        "body_text": "Threat levels for ships sailing through the Red Sea and Suez Canal increased over the weekend, according to Dryad Global, a maritime security firm. On Saturday, Dec. 16, the U.S. Central Command announced on X that it had deflected a barrage of 14 drone strikes from Houthi controlled areas. “It looks like the threat level has increased to almost any vessel and now we have 4 major shipping companies suspending operations in this region and are taking the route around Africa,” wrote Corey Ranslem, the CEO of Dryad Global—a prominent maritime security firm—in an email to TIME on Monday.Over 80% of the world’s traded goods are transported via ocean, since traveling by sea is more cost effective in most cases, according to the International Chamber of Shipping. Attacks from the Houthis began during the Israel-Hamas war when the militant group vowed to attack all ships stopping at Israeli ports.The first iteration of the Houthis emerged with a group called the Believing Youth, who led a revivalist movement for the Zaydi branch of Islam in the 1990s. Many Zaydi muslims, who make up about 35% of the country, felt that the increasing presence of Saudi-influenced Salafi Islam was interfering with their cultural heritage and rights. In 2004, the group evolved and came to be known as the Houthis after their leader Hussein al-Houthi was killed. It was also around this time that they began launching insurgencies against Yemen’s government. “Some of their grievances against the government aligned with the grievances of other sectors of Yemeni society around government corruption and mismanagement, but they also had some specific grievances regarding perceived infringement on the cultural rights of Zaydi Muslims,” says Stacey Philbrick Yadav, the chair of international relations at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who published a book about Yemen’s war in January.In 2011, grievances among the Yemeni over poor economic conditions and corruption boiled over into mass protests that eventually led to the ousting of Yemen’s president Ali Abdullah Saleh who had been in power for 34 years. The international community then tried to establish a transitional government for Yemen that excluded the Houthis, which led the Houthis to forcefully enter the capital of Yemen to demand inclusion in the government. The conflict intensified in 2015 when Houthi rebels aligned with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh against the internationally-backed government.Saudi Arabia has been a leading force in the war against the Houthis. Because of this, the Houthis have grown more aligned with Iran. Nevertheless, Philbrick Yadav, who spoke to TIME over the phone, says that she wouldn’t go so far as to call them a direct Iranian proxy. “They do have a relationship with and support from Iran, but are not a straightforward proxy of Iranian interests. They have their own locally defined interests and so I think that their actions in the past two months have reflected that,” she says. In Yemen, supporting Palestinian people is an extremely popular opinion. Philbrick Yadav says that showing support for Palestine helps the Houthis gain popularity. “This is a way in which the Houthis can try to expand their appeal to Yemenis who don't support their domestic political project,” she says.Over 80% of the world’s traded goods are transported via sea vessels, meaning that the annual shipping trade is worth over 14 trillion dollars, according to the International Chamber of Shipping, or 16% of global GDP. Transporting items via sea is usually more cost effective than moving via air, meaning that the shipping industry is essential for transporting nearly every imported product we use—from clothing and cars to oil and gas. The Red Sea directly feeds into the Suez Canal, the only water route available for ships traveling from Asia to Europe without having to sail around the African continent. Ranslem says that traveling via the Suez Canal and Red Sea can save ships over 30 days in travel time. “Depending on where the vessel is headed for its ultimate destination, to go around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa could be extremely expensive and time consuming, and you have pretty challenging weather conditions,” Ranslem tells TIME during a phone call. “But at the same time now, vessels transiting through this region of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea are also seeing their costs rise because insurance companies are continuing to increase premiums.”According to Reuters, war risk premiums have risen from approximately 0.07% of the value of the ship last week to up to 0.2% the value of the ship this week. This can increase the cost of a single seven-day voyage by tens of thousands of dollars. The Houthis have publicly stated that they are targeting ships that they believe are stopping in Israel. So far, Ranslem says that most of the attacks have been targeted at ships that were planning to stop in either Ashdod or Haifa, prominent port cities in Israel. Before the attacks, both ports had a list of ships expected to arrive over the next several weeks published online. Those lists have been taken down. “Right now, any vessel that is transiting through this region that is heading to an Israeli port is at a much higher risk than other vessels,” says Ranslem. However, Ranslem says that in the aftermath of the drone barrage this weekend, all other ships traveling through the region are at risk as well.U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters on Dec. 4 that the U.S. is working to build a coalition with partner nations to provide protection for global shipping in the region. However, it will likely take several weeks or months before any such plan can effectively provide protection, argues Ranslem. This means the ships seemingly remain at risk for now.",

        "body_text": "On Friday morning, a Ukrainian village council member threw grenades on the floor during a meeting, according to local authorities. The meeting was live-streamed on Facebook, where onlookers could hear explosions and screams at the incident that took place at council headquarters in Kerets'ky. At least 26 people were wounded, including six who were seriously injured, police said. The video was also shared by the National Police of Ukraine on Telegram. Officers said they were first informed of the incident at 11:37 a.m. local time. Initial calls to authorities said that the detonator died as a result of the explosion, but a message sent at 5:34 a.m. eastern time by police said that medics were “performing resuscitation measures on the” suspect. His current health status is unknown to us. TIME has reached out to the local authorities for further information.Video footage shows a council member entering the meeting room during a heated discussion. The man then stands next to the door before he throws three grenades onto the floor. Some Ukranians have access to weapons due to the ongoing war with Russia, according to the BBC. Investigators said they were assessing the event as a violation. A translation of the Telegram note reads:  “Art. 263—illegal handling of weapons, ammunition or explosives of the criminal code.” They are also looking at it “in accordance with part 1 of Article 258 (terrorist act) of the Criminal Code.” The name of the suspect has not been announced. ",

        "body_text": "A Vatican cardinal and former advisor to Pope Francis was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison on Saturday.Cardinal Angelo Becciu was convicted in a trial that lasted two-and-a-half years and involved nine other defendants. Becciu resigned from his high-ranking post within the Catholic Church in 2020, but said he was told to do so by the Pope after an investigation into potential financial crimes was published by Italian news magazine L’Espresso. Once considered a papal contender, Becciu became the first cardinal ever prosecuted by the Vatican’s court, the Associated Press reported.Becciu was also found not guilty on some charges. He has previously denied the allegations, and his lawyer said he would appeal the sentencing.Most of the charges centered on a “highly speculative” purchase of a luxury property in London’s affluent area of Chelsea, while Becciu was a senior leader in the Vatican’s Secretariat of State. The property was later sold at a loss of at least €140 million ($152 million), Vatican News said. Two financiers involved in the property sale were also found guilty of financial crimes and received sentences of five-and-half years and six years. The initial London investigation led to other allegations, with prosecutors accusing Becciu of embezzlement for sending €125,000 ($136,000) of Vatican money to a charity run by his brother and paying a woman €575,000 ($627,000) for her intelligence services, the AP reported. The woman was sentenced to three years and nine months. In response to the first accusation, Becciu argued the local bishop requested the money, which remained with the church, to support charity work. To the latter, he said he thought the money was going to pay a security service to negotiate the release of a nun taken hostage by militants connected to al-Qaeda in Mali in 2017. Two former Vatican officials were also sentenced to seven years on Saturday, while another two received fines, Vatican News said. A lawyer and former advisor to the Secretariat, who helped negotiate the property deal, received one year and 10 months.  TIME reached out to the Vatican press office, which was not open at the time of publication, for information and comment.",

        "body_text": "CAIRO — A boat carrying dozens of migrants trying to reach Europe capsized off the coast of Libya, leaving more than 60 people dead, including women and children, the U.N. migration agency said.Saturday’s shipwreck was the latest tragedy in this part of the Mediterranean Sea, a key but dangerous route for migrants seeking a better life in Europe. Thousands have died, according to officials.The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration said in a statement the boat was carrying 86 migrants when strong waves swamped it off the town of Zuwara on Libya’s western coast and that 61 migrants drowned, according to survivors.“The central Mediterranean continues to be one of the world’s most dangerous migration routes,” the agency wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.Alarm Phone — a hotline for migrants in distress — said in a tweet that some migrants onboard reached out to the volunteer group who in turn alerted authorities including the “Libyan coastguard who stated that they would not search for them.”A spokesman for the Libyan coast guard was not immediately available for comment.Libya has in recent years emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East, even though the North African nation has plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime autocrat Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.More than 2,250 people died on the central European route this year, according to Flavio Di Giacomo, an IOM spokesperson.It’s “a dramatic figure which demonstrates that unfortunately not enough is being done to save lives at sea,” Di Giacomo wrote on X.According to the IOM’s missing migrants project, at least 940 migrants were reported dead and 1,248 missing off Libya between Jan. 1 and Nov. 18.The project, which tracks migration movements, said about 14,900 migrants, including over 1,000 women and more than 530 children, were intercepted and returned to Libya this year.In 2022, the project reported 529 dead and 848 missing off Libya. Over 24,600 were intercepted and returned to Libya.Human traffickers in recent years have benefited from the chaos in Libya, smuggling in migrants across the country’s lengthy borders, which it shares with six nations. The migrants are crowded onto ill-equipped vessels, including rubber boats, and set off on risky sea voyages.Those who are intercepted and returned to Libya are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture — practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to U.N.-commissioned investigators.The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers’ boats to Europe.",

        "title_text": "European Ministers Call For a ‘Sustainable Ceasefire’ in Gaza. Here’s What That Means",
        "body_text": "U.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron and German foreign affairs minister Annalena Baerbock expressed in an editorial for The Sunday Times their backing of a “sustainable ceasefire” in its war against Hamas in Gaza. Cameron and Baerbock highlighted the difference between a sustainable ceasefire and an “immediate ceasefire,” which has been widely called for elsewhere. ”Let us be clear. We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward,” they argued. Instead, they envision reaching a peace which lasts “for days, years, generations.”Cameron and Baerbock are putting more pressure on Israel to protect civilians after Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said more than 18,000 people have died. The ministers said that “too many civilians have been killed,” and while Israel has a right to defend itself, it must do so respecting international law and distinguishing more between Hamas militants and civilians. In contrast, France’s foreign minister called for an “immediate and durable” ceasefire in a visit to Israel on Sunday. Last month, France’s President Emmanuel Macron said Israel should stop bombing that was killing women and children, who the U.N. reported make up two-thirds of the dead in Gaza. On Tuesday, 153 countries at the U.N. General Assembly voted in favor of a ceasefire, with the U.K. and Germany abstaining. Protesters across the globe have marched to call an immediate end to bombing and fighting. Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire as it fights to eliminate Hamas after the militant group killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 200 hostage on Oct. 7. Scrutiny of the war has been growing, with U.S. officials meeting with their Israeli counterparts to push for more protections for civilians. U.S. President Joe Biden warned on Dec. 12 that Israel was losing international support because of “indiscriminate bombing,” and on Dec. 14 said “I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives, not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.” The remarks have marked a shift in tone for the Biden administration, which previously said it was drawing “no red lines” for Israel. The U.S. has not called for a ceasefire. The German and British ministers argued that pushing Israel to cease its military operations would not stop Hamas from firing rockets or push them to release more than 100 hostages remaining in Gaza. Instead, the ministers said they supported humanitarian pauses. A weeklong truce at the end of November led to the releases of dozens of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and got more humanitarian aid to Gaza, where the U.N. World Food Programme said this week that half of the territory’s 2.3 million people are starving. The European leaders said they had increased aid support and praised the opening of a crossing between Israel and Gaza to allow more access. The foreign ministers argued that a two-state solution was the only path forward to peace, and leaving Hamas in power in Gaza would be a “permanent roadblock” to that aim, but didn’t specify how this might be achieved.TIME reached out to the German Foreign Ministry for further information on its vision for Gaza and how that might be achieved. The department flagged that Baerbock met with the Lebanese foreign minister on Friday in an effort to work on peace in the region, and last month outlined steps toward a two-state solution. In response to TIME seeking further information on how the U.K. government would achieve a sustainable ceasefire while fighting continued and what steps it is taking to negotiate a lasting peace, the Foreign Ministry said that the op-ed reflects the government's latest position.In November, meanwhile, Biden wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post that a two-state solution was the only way forward and said a re-envisioned Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, should rule Gaza as well. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told NBC’s Meet the Press in November that he didn’t think the Palestinian Authority should run Gaza, and members of his government have spoken out against a two-state solution. In an interview with Sky News, the Israeli ambassador to the U.K., Tzipi Hotovely, said “absolutely no,” when asked about whether Palestinians should be given a state. Netanyahu said in an address on Saturday about the war that his government was “as committed as ever to continue until the end, until we dismantle Hamas, until we return all our hostages.” Experts have written for TIME that it would be impossible to eliminate the extremist ideology of Hamas, although the government controlling Gaza could be destroyed, leaving a void that would need to be filled.",

        "title_text": "Australia’s Queensland Battles Severe Floods as Girl Is Seriously Injured by Lightning Strike",
        "body_text": "Severe storms and flooding pounded the Queensland state of Australia on Sunday in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Jasper. Roads were destroyed, power down for thousands and rescues underway, with the deluge expected to continue into Monday. Amid the dangerous weather, a 30-year-old man died after being found unconscious beside fallen power lines, while a 10-year-old girl was “fighting for her life” after being struck by lightning, according to Queensland Police. Last year, flooding in Queensland killed two dozen people. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology issued a tropical cyclone warning on Dec. 10 as Cyclone Jasper prepared to bear down on northeast Australia, predicting heavy rainfall. On Sunday, the government agency said the ex-cyclone was still sitting over the coast and issued marine wind, flood and severe storm warnings for different parts of Queensland until Monday night, warning residents to move to higher ground as intense rainfall could cause “dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding.” Queensland Premier Steven Miles shared an update via social media on Sunday evening that there was a “severe weather emergency” playing out in the far north part of the state. Some communities had received up to 600mm (two feet) of rain in the past day, he said. More than 10,000 people were without power and roads had been cut off, with some bridges damaged beyond use.In Murarrie, Brisbane, a 30-year-old man was found unconscious near fallen power lines during a thunderstorm with life-threatening injuries on Friday, Queensland police said. He was declared dead shortly afterwards. The Guardian reported a 10-year-old girl was in critical condition after she was struck by lightning in the town of Beerwah on Sunday, citing police. She was taken to Sunshine Coast University Hospital before being flown to Queensland Children's Hospital. TIME was unable to reach police, but contacted Queensland Fire and Emergency Services to verify and find out if there were any other injuries or casualties.  In response to large numbers of urgent calls for assistance, the government has deployed significant numbers of rescue vessels, Miles said in another social media update. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services responded to 532 requests for assistance across the state, The Guardian reported, with difficulty reaching multiple groups of people for rescue because of flooding. The emergency response agency issued a stern warning on Facebook to never drive in floodwaters after reporting that people were rescued from cars after “deliberately” driving into water. Shane Chelepy, Queensland Police’s Deputy Commissioner, said in a news conference Sunday afternoon that emergency responders had made a number of rescues, with 37 people staying in five evacuation centers. Police said they evacuated 12 people from their homes after a river broke its banks around 1 a.m. on Dec. 14. One home was inundated with water and multiple cars damaged, police said. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said in the Sunday news conference that the city of Cairns expected to see waters above 1977 flood levels, previously the biggest on record for the region. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Cairns had become an island, with roads blocked to the north, south and west. As of Sunday night, hundreds of homes had been flooded and local mayors were appealing for military intervention as they exhausted local resources. Prime Minister Anthony Albonese posted pictures showing the severe scale of flooding in Cairns, with the shuttered airport swamped with water and roads rivened, and said his government was working closely with local authorities to ensure assistance was available. In the aboriginal area of Wujal Wujal, which was under an emergency alert, the council reported widespread flooding, stores closed and power out on its Facebook page. The local government urged people to stay away from floodwaters, warning of a crocodile at a bridge crossing near where children were swimming. The council said 4G communications would be switched off to preserve battery life from 11 p.m. Sunday until Monday morning, meaning people would still be able to make voice calls but would have slower internet.The Bureau of Meteorology urged the public to go inside strong buildings, not drive and park their car undercover away from trees, close windows and doors, charge devices in case of loss of power later on, and keep asthma medications nearby as storms and wind can trigger respiratory attacks. Miles said those in distress can contact the State Emergency Service on 132 500 and call 000 if the situation was life-threatening. People dealing with damages can reach out to the Queensland Community Recovery Hotline on 1800 173 349 or Queensland Government's specialized Tropical Cyclone Jasper web page for information about financial grants and support services.",

        "title_text": "North Korea Fires Ballistic Missile Into the Sea as South Korea, U.S. Step Up Deterrence Plans",
        "body_text": "SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Sunday fired a short-range ballistic missile into the sea, South Korea said, in a possible display of defiance against the latest steps by Washington and Seoul to tighten their nuclear deterrence plans against North Korean threats.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was fired from an area near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang at around 10:38 p.m. and flew 570 kilometers (354 miles) before landing in the sea.The South Korean military said it was sharing the launch information with the United States and Japan to further analyze the details while maintaining readiness against the possibility of additional North Korean military activities. It criticized the launch as a “clear violation” of U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban North Korea from using ballistic technologies.Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest in years, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerating the expansion of his nuclear and missile program, and flaunting an escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive use of nuclear weapons.The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by increasing the visibility of their trilateral partnership in the region, and strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim condemns as invasion rehearsals.North Korea’s latest launch followed high-level security talks between American and South Korean officials in Washington over the weekend, where they agreed on plans to update their nuclear deterrence and contingency strategies and incorporate nuclear operation scenarios in their combined military exercises next summer to cope with the North’s evolving threats.Shortly after the launch, North Korea’s Defense Ministry issued a statement condemning Washington and Seoul’s move to include nuclear operation scenarios in their joint drills, describing it as an open threat to potentially use nuclear weapons against the North and vowing to prepare unspecified “offensive countermeasures.”The North Korean ministry also criticized the United States for increasingly deploying major military assets to South Korea in a show of strength, including strategic bombers and nuclear-powered submarines, which it claimed amounted to a “reckless military threat” that was destabilizing the region.The ministry did not mention the missile launch.South Korea has been seeking stronger reassurances from the United States that it would swiftly and decisively use its nuclear capabilities to defend its ally in the event of a North Korean nuclear attack.The North has test-fired more than 100 missiles since the start of 2022 as Kim used the distraction caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine to speed up the expansion of his military nuclear program, which he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.The weapons that North Korea tested in recent months included intercontinental ballistic missiles that demonstrated a potential range to reach the U.S. mainland, and a series of launch events the North described as simulated nuclear attacks on targets in South Korea.Last month, North Korea also launched its first military reconnaissance satellite, which Kim described as a crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles.Washington and its allies have also expressed concerns about a potential arms alignment between North Korea and Russia. They worry that Kim is providing badly needed munitions to help Russian President Vladimir Putin wage war in Ukraine in exchange for Russian technology assistance to upgrade his nuclear-armed military.",

        "title_text": "As Israel Reckons With Killing of Hostages, Critics Worry About Routine Excessive Force Against Civilians",
        "body_text": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israelis were left stunned and speechless when three hostages held by Hamas were killed by Israeli forces in the middle of an active war zone after they waved a white flag and screamed out in Hebrew to show they did not pose a threat.For some, the incident was a shocking example of the ugliness of war, where a complex and dangerous battlefield is safe for no one. But for critics, the incident underscores what they say is the excessively violent conduct of Israel's security apparatus against Palestinians. Except in this case, it cut short the lives of three Israelis trying desperately to save themselves.“It’s heartbreaking but it’s not surprising,” said Roy Yellin, director of public outreach with the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. “We have documented over the years countless incidents of people who clearly surrendered and who were still shot.”Yellin said the killings violated basic military ethics and international law that prohibit shooting at people trying to surrender, whether combatants or not. But he said it was part of a long trend of largely unpunished excessive force that in recent weeks has ensnared Israelis themselves.According to a military official, the three hostages, all men in their 20s, emerged from a building close to Israeli soldiers’ positions in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, where troops have been battling Hamas militants in intense combat.They waved a white flag and were shirtless, possibly trying to signal they posed no threat. Two were killed immediately, and the third ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew. The commander issued an order to cease fire, but another burst of gunfire killed the third man, the official said.The army's chief, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi, said hostages “did everything possible” to make it clear they did not pose a threat, but that the soldiers acted “during combat and under pressure.”On Sunday, Halevi reviewed the rules of engagement with troops, saying the prohibition against opening fire on those who surrender must also apply to Palestinians.“When you see two people who do not threaten you, who don’t have weapons, who have their hands up and are not wearing shirts, take two seconds,\" he said in comments broadcast on Israeli TV. \"And I want to tell you something that is no less important: if these are two Gazans with a white flag who want to surrender, will we shoot them? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. That is not the IDF (Israel Defense Forces).”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that the killings “broke my heart, broke the entire nation’s heart,” but he indicated no change in Israel’s intensive military campaign. With popular opinion firmly behind the military effort, the hostages' deaths weren’t likely to prompt a change in the public mood.Israel says a number of hostages have died in Hamas captivity. But the deaths of the three hostages struck a nerve because they were killed by the forces trying to rescue them.Roughly 129 hostages remain in the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli military, and their plight has gripped the nation, which sees their captivity as the embodiment of the security failure surrounding Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war. The hostages’ deaths prompted hundreds of demonstrators to take to the streets in anger.It also came days after another incident raised questions about Israel’s open-fire rules. After Hamas militants shot at a busy Jerusalem bus stop, an Israeli man who had rushed to confront the attackers was gunned down by an Israeli soldier, even though he had raised his hands, knelt on the ground and flung open his shirt to indicate he wasn’t a threat. The military has launched an investigation.Critics see a direct link between a long list of shooting deaths of Palestinians—from the killing of 32-year-old autistic man Eyad Hallaq, to the death of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, and many more over the years—to the incidents that led to the deaths of Israelis.Most recently, B’Tselem accused the army of carrying out a pair of “illegal executions” after releasing video footage that appeared to show Israeli troops killing two Palestinian men—one who was incapacitated and the second unarmed—during a military raid in the occupied West Bank. Military police are investigating, but rights groups say such incidents rarely lead to punitive measures.Critics say the hostages incident reflects the military's conduct toward civilians in Gaza. More than 18,700 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, of whom about two-thirds are said to be women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.Avner Gvaryahu, who heads Breaking the Silence, a whistleblower group that documents testimonies of former Israeli soldiers, said soldier accounts from previous military engagements in the Gaza Strip showed that once an area was deemed by the military to be cleared of civilians, they were instructed to “shoot everything that moves.”“The army said this happened in violation of the rules of engagement. I’m skeptical of that, based on what we know of previous operations in Gaza,” he said. “How many Palestinians were shot at like this?”The military says it does what it can to protect civilians, but says it faces a complex arena where Hamas embeds itself in densely populated civilian areas. Palestinians on several occasions have said Israeli soldiers opened fire in Gaza as civilians tried to flee to safety.Kobi Michael, a senior researcher with the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank, disputed the comparisons between the hostage deaths to the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank or the killing of the Israeli civilian in Jerusalem. He said each case needed to be seen on its own, rather than as part of a broader trend.“It shouldn’t have happened but we are in a war and it’s not a sterile environment,” said Michael, who is a former senior official at Israel's Ministry for Strategic Affairs. “We need to understand the context.”The killing of Israeli civilians in recent weeks has prompted a reckoning for some Israelis. Nahum Barnea, a leading commentator, wrote in Yediot Ahronot that the hostage incident was a crime and could not be passed over “as if it were nothing.”Ben Caspit, writing in the daily Maariv, said the rise of Israel's far-right has helped create an environment that makes it easier for forces to open fire.He also highlighted a common sentiment among Israel's hard-line right wing that there are no noncombatants in Gaza. That has fueled concerns among critics that Israeli forces are not being discriminate in their combat.“In recent years our finger has become too light on the trigger. The recent events have made it even lighter,” he wrote. “There are noncombatants in Gaza, and three of them were killed this weekend by our own soldiers.”",

        "body_text": "Taiwan said two Chinese weather balloons crossed a line in the strait that the U.S. drew decades ago to help ease tensions between the two sides.One balloon was spotted at 9:03 a.m. Sunday and the other at 2:43 p.m., the Defense Ministry in Taipei said in a statement. They continued traveling eastward and disappeared, it added.Ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang told reporters via social media on Monday that an initial assessment found the aircraft were for meteorological use.The U.S. drew the median line in the body of water separating Taiwan from China in 1954 during a period of heightened friction between Beijing and Taipei. China long refrained from crossing the line but recently has been stepping up flights by warplanes across it, a move that wears down Taiwan’s smaller armed forces.Earlier in 2023, a Chinese balloon derailed ties between Beijing and Washington. The U.S. said the aircraft was for surveillance and shot it down. China said it was for weather purposes and the Biden administration overreacted.Taiwan began to release details of balloon sightings this month, though Sun said earlier that the ministry has long been spotting them. The Defense Ministry for the island of 23 million people that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pledged to bring under control someday said earlier that a Chinese balloon crossed the median line on Dec. 7.Read More: ‘The Best Way to Preserve Peace Is to Be Able to Fight a War’: Taiwan’s Foreign Minister on Resisting Chinese AggressionChina Meteorological Administration issued a notice last week that urged weather officials across the country to “effectively prevent major safety accidents” when launching balloons.

        "body_text": "Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan is behind bars, and his party isn’t allowed to hold in-person rallies in the country ahead of elections in February. But that hasn’t stopped Khan from speaking to his supporters, with a little help from artificial intelligence.On Sunday, Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party streamed a five-hour “virtual powershow,” an online rally featuring at its end a four-minute speech written by the jailed Khan and delivered by an A.I. voice replicating the 71-year-old former cricket star turned political leader. Within 12 hours, it had already racked up more than 1.5 million views on YouTube.Read More: Imran Khan on His Plan to Return to Power“My fellow Pakistanis, I would first like to praise the social media team for this historic attempt,” the A.I.-assisted Khan said on Sunday, according to Agence France-Presse. “This was a no-brainer for us,” PTI’s social media chief Jibran Ilyas told AFP. “No PTI political rally is complete without Imran Khan.”The event, however, was also met with reduced internet speeds and limited access to social media platforms—disruptions that Pakistani authorities are believed to have instigated ahead of the rally—that have further stoked concerns about the fairness of the country’s upcoming election. The election commision has been accused of amending constituency borders to favor Khan’s opponent, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Meanwhile, mention of Khan’s name or image has been blacklisted in mainstream media in Pakistan, and thousands of Khan’s allies and supporters have had their homes raided and been arrested.“Our people are being kidnapped and their families are being harassed,” the A.I.-voiced Khan said in his speech on Sunday.Khan, who remained Pakistan’s most popular politician as of March, was toppled in April 2022 by the country’s powerful military establishment. He was arrested in August and sentenced to three years in jail for illegally selling gifts from other heads of state. Despite being granted bail, he has been held in jail for allegedly leaking classified documents—which, like other charges he faces mostly of corruption, he claims is politically motivated.",

        "title_text": "What to Know About the Hacker Group That Shut Down 70% of Iran’s Gas Stations",
        "body_text": "Around 70% of Iran’s petrol stations have seen their services disrupted Monday after a massive cyber attack was carried out by the hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, which translates to “Predatory Sparrow” in Farsi. The group has also claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian petrol stations, rail networks and steel factories, according to Iranian state media. The attacks have forced many Petrol stations to operate their pumps manually. “We, Gonjeshke Darande, carried out another cyberattack today, taking out a majority of the gas pumps throughout Iran. This cyberattack comes in response to the aggression of the Islamic Republic and its proxies in the region,” wrote the group on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We delivered warnings to emergency services across the country before the operation began, and ensured a portion of the gas stations across the country were left unharmed for the same reason, despite our access and capability to completely disrupt their operation.”The group joined X in December 2023 and has previously been linked to Israel, according to the Times of Israel. Approximately 300,000 Iranian Jews live in Israel, most of whom fled Iran as refugees during the 1979 revolution, when the Iranian Jewish community was heavily persecuted and a frequent target of state-sanctioned violence. Many Iranian Jews living in Israel were educated in Iran and speak fluent Farsi. The last time a major cyberattack disrupted Iranian fuel supply was in Oct. 2021. Iran similarly accused Israel and the United States of being behind those attacks. Iran’s civil defense agency, which oversees the country’s cybersecurity, says that it is still investigating the attack. Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum also told an Iranian television station that the disruption at gas stations would not impact the price of fuel. Iranian fuel is heavily subsidized by the state, and plans to raise fuel prices in 2019 led to major protests across the country that year.",

        "title_text": "Pope Approves Blessings for Same-Sex Couples",
        "body_text": "ROME — Pope Francis has formally approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, with a new document explaining a radical change in Vatican policy by insisting that people seeking God’s love and mercy shouldn’t be subject to “an exhaustive moral analysis” to receive it.The document from the Vatican’s doctrine office, released Monday, elaborates on a letter Francis sent to two conservative cardinals that was published in October. In that preliminary response, Francis suggested such blessings could be offered under some circumstances if they didn’t confuse the ritual with the sacrament of marriage.The new document repeats that condition and elaborates on it, reaffirming that marriage is a lifelong sacrament between a man and a woman. And it stresses that blessings in question must be non-liturgical in nature and should not be conferred at the same time as a civil union, using set rituals or even with the clothing and gestures that belong in a wedding.But it says requests for such blessings for same-sex couples should not be denied full stop. It offers an extensive and broad definition of the term “blessing” in Scripture to insist that people seeking a transcendent relationship with God and looking for his love and mercy should not be subject to “an exhaustive moral analysis” as a precondition for receiving it.“Ultimately, a blessing offers people a means to increase their trust in God,” the document said. “The request for a blessing, thus, expresses and nurtures openness to the transcendence, mercy, and closeness to God in a thousand concrete circumstances of life, which is no small thing in the world in which we live.”He added: \"It is a seed of the Holy Spirit that must be nurtured, not hindered.”The Vatican holds that marriage is an indissoluble union between man and woman. As a result, it has long opposed same-sex marriage.And in 2021, the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said flat-out that the church couldn’t bless the unions of two men or two women because “God cannot bless sin.”That document created an outcry, one it appeared even Francis was blindsided by even though he had technically approved its publication. Soon after it was published, he removed the official responsible for it and set about laying the groundwork for a reversal.In the new document, the Vatican said the church must shy away from “doctrinal or disciplinary schemes, especially when they lead to a narcissistic and authoritarian elitism whereby instead of evangelizing, one analyzes and classifies others, and instead of opening the door to grace, one exhausts his or her energies in inspecting and verifying.\"It stressed that people in “irregular” unions — gay or straight — are in a state of sin. But it said that shouldn’t deprive them of God’s love or mercy.“Thus, when people ask for a blessing, an exhaustive moral analysis should not be placed as a precondition for conferring it,” the document said.The Rev. James Martin, who advocates for greater welcome for LGBTQ+ Catholics, praised the new document as a “huge step forward” and a “dramatic shift” from the Vatican's 2021 policy.The new document “recognizes the deep desire in many Catholic same-sex couples for God’s presence and help in their committed relationships,” he said in an email. \"Along with many Catholic priests, I will now be delighted to bless my friends in same-sex marriages.”",

        "title_text": "The Biden Administration’s Slow Yes Has Doomed Ukraine",
        "body_text": "It’s often been said that the second-best answer to yes is a fast no, and that the worst answer of all is a slow no. As the war in Ukraine closes out its second year, and as victory on the battlefield or a negotiated settlement appear as elusive as ever, we’re seeing that when it has come to Ukraine’s requests for international support—particularly military aid—there’s an answer that has proven worse than a slow no: the slow yes.As President Zelensky petitions the U.S. and NATO for continued support, with high-profile visits to several capitals in December, and as Congress fights over another aid package to Ukraine, the U.S. and NATO are now shipping to Kyiv many of the sensitive weapon systems that Ukrainian officials have been requesting since 2022. Despite shortfalls in Western production capacity, this includes first-generation main battle tanks like the M1A1 Abrams, long range precision artillery like HIMARS, and fighter jets like the F-16. As these weapons systems arrived on the battlefield in the last few months, albeit in smaller numbers than the Ukrainians would like, it’s to an environment that’s changed radically since they were first requested. Large swaths of territory haven’t exchanged hands between Russia and Ukraine in more than a year. Putin’s forces are no longer stunned by Ukrainian overperformance, but dug in with extensive fortifications and trenches. The war of movement is over. Opportunity is dwindling.In the first six months of the war, when Ukraine seized the initiative on the battlefield, it was easy to imagine that if the U.S. and NATO had then aggressively fulfilled Ukraine’s requests for weapons and the training of their crews, which also takes time, that this could’ve had a decisive impact. In the lead up to war and the early days of the invasion, the argument against sending military aid to Ukraine was that their understrength military didn’t stand a chance against the Russians. However, as Ukraine mounted a successful resistance, the argument against providing NATO weapons systems to Ukraine changed. NATO and the U.S. refused to provide Ukraine with many of the weapons it’s providing now out of fear that this could lead to an escalation of the war, in which Russia might attack a NATO member nation or turn the war nuclear.Read More: Zelensky's Struggle to Keep Ukraine in the FightPutin adeptly stoked fear of escalation among Ukraine’s allies even though many analysts believed those fears were overblown. In those critical early months, when the Russian military was off balance, the Biden Administration claimed to be concerned that if Putin saw the wrong type of tank, missile, or jet in Ukraine, he might respond with a nuclear weapon. These fears caused the Biden Administration and European allies to squander precious time, and that time allowed Russia to regroup.In October 2022, after Ukraine had launched its successful Kharkiv counteroffensive that reclaimed 12,000 square kilometers of territory, President Biden didn’t tout this success; instead, he warned Americans of a potential “nuclear Armageddon” after Putin insinuated that his lost territory could lead to grave consequences for Ukraine and the West. When it comes to military aid, Putin has used his nuclear deterrence to regulate the flow of conventional arms to Ukraine. And that has given him a key advantage to set the pace for parts of the war. He chose when to ratchet up or down his threats and the U.S. responded by ratcheting up or down supplies. This has led to a kind of phony war, in which the U.S. and NATO cheer Ukraine’s victories and gradually provide Ukraine with high-end weapons, but dole them out slowly and in numbers small enough to allow Ukraine to fight but not to win.This is America and NATO’s slow yes strategy.In war every country pursues its national interests. Although the interest of the U.S. and Ukraine overlap, they’re not one in the same. Ukraine is fighting a war of national survival, an existential war. When it comes to Russia, throughout its  history failed wars have preceded the collapse of the regime. Whether it’s the First World War and the collapse of the Tzarist Regime, or the War in Afghanistan and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia’s autocracies seldom survive a lost war. And so, like Ukraine, Putin is also fighting an existential war.This has led to a paradox in U.S. policy. We believe that the survival of Ukraine is key to the stability of Europe. But we also recognize that if Putin believes he is going to lose, he’ll become volatile. We fear what this means for the stability of Europe and even the world. When it comes to U.S. national interests, having either side win the war outright is too dangerous. So instead, we’ve crafted a policy that seems to allow neither side to lose. Our slow yes is bleeding Ukraine and Russia dry.As Russia continues to reinforce its frontline positions, and as Ukraine finally receives higher-end weapons systems from NATO and pursues EU membership, it would appear as though the war is entering its frozen stage—a stage which neither side can win. Such an outcome wouldn’t preclude ceasefire negotiations akin to those that occurred in the Korean War, a conflict that, technically, is still ongoing. However, this outcome precludes the “victory” Ukrainians have spoken of since Putin’s invasion, in which the territories Russia seized in 2022 and even, perhaps, in 2014 would be returned to Ukraine.Had the Biden administration and its NATO allies decisively armed and supported Ukraine in the early days of the war, it’s possible the Russian invasion could’ve failed. But such decisive support was probably never going to arrive. Our national interests didn’t align closely enough with Ukraine’s. A strategy as simple and clear as President Reagan’s famous Cold War imperative “We win, they lose” isn’t practicable in today’s multipolar world. The U.S. has long been operating as though it needs a stable Russia as much as it needs a free Ukraine.In the New Year the war will continue. The new weapons will arrive, and progress will continue to be measured in small increments. Ukraine’s allies will continue to offer a slow yes in response to requests they send us in blood. ",

        "body_text": "An earthquake that struck Gansu province, northwestern China, at 11.59 p.m. Monday local time has killed more than 100 people and injured hundreds more, as Chinese President Xi Jinping calls for “all-out search and rescue efforts” for those affected by the earthquake. One hundred and thirteen people were killed and 536 were injured in Gansu province, which is among the poorest regions in China and where the epicenter was located. At least 18 other people were killed in neighboring Qinghai province, and 198 were injured, state media reported. A number of aftershocks have followed the initial earthquake—a total of nine as of Tuesday morning, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center.Photos and videos of the quake’s aftermath on social media showed collapsed houses and debris, and residents running to exit buildings or huddled in the cold outside. Temperatures are expected to reach as low as negative 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) in affected areas on Tuesday, amid a cold snap in northern China. “The disaster zone is located in an area with high altitude and cold weather,”  Xi said in his message on Tuesday. “We must closely monitor the quake and weather changes, to prevent secondary disasters.”Rescue workers were seen repairing power supply facilities damaged by the earthquake, digging through rubble, and preparing disaster relief supplies such as tents and foldable beds. By Tuesday morning, over 1,000 emergency personnel had embarked on rescue operations in the affected areas. Top provincial officials also headed to the disaster zone overnight, local media reported. China’s transport ministry said that cracks have been observed on a bridge over the Yellow River on Tuesday morning, and only emergency relief vehicles and small cars are allowed to cross the bridge. The U.S. Geological Survey logged the earthquake at magnitude 5.9, the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre recorded it at 6.1, while Chinese state media reported the quake as having a magnitude of 6.2. Posts about the earthquake in Gansu, many tagged with the phrase “Pray for Gansu,” have dominated discussion on Chinese social media, racking up more than 600 million views and becoming the most discussed topic on Weibo as of Tuesday.According to the China Earthquake Networks Center, on Tuesday morning at 9.46 a.m. local time, another earthquake of magnitude 5.5 struck Atush City in Xinjiang Province—which borders Gansu and is similarly prone to earthquakes—though there have been no official reports of casualties.",

        "body_text": "Editor's Note: In an earlier post compiled from emails, Amal Murtaja wrote of her family's experience in the war that began on Oct. 7, the day Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel and abducted 240. Israel's military response has killed more than 19,000 people in the Gaza Strip, including the wife and two children of Murataja's brother, Amer.  I usually plan my week ahead.On Oct. 5, Hamood was extremely excited because I got him a new Cristiano Ronaldo uniform, which he didn’t get to wear anyway. Later that day, we went to Sara and Mariam’s birthday party, my twin nieces. The next day, we went to the horse riding club. On Oct. 7, I was supposed to take Hamood to the optics shop to make him new glasses; on Oct. 8, I was supposed to give my students a new story; on Oct. 9, I planned with my mom to go to our favorite kitchenware shop; and on Oct. 10, I planned with Alaa, my sister, to finally try the new seafood restaurant called “Bab El-Bahar” with our kids. I had a week planned because I thought life was good. But my brother Amer, father of Omar and Zaid, always takes me back to how the events of Oct. 7. turned out so differently than what I had planned. We live near each other, and we have enrolled our children in the same kindergarten. Ali, my son, is in KG0; his son Zaid was in KG1, and Omar was in KG2. My brother used to come by to take Ali to kindergarten along with his sons. That day, I woke up startled by the sounds of the rockets and hurried to the balcony to see what was going on and to check if the rockets were coming down at us or being fired away. I sent my brother a text: “Amer, don’t take your kids to school; it looks like this will turn into a war. Stay safe.\"Amer always reminds me, “We were going to school that day like any other day.” I hate myself sometimes for not finding the right words to tell my grieving brother about the loss of his family. I just sit there and cry along with him. No comforting words can or will heal his aching heart. Amer was a great father; he read them bedtime stories, took them wherever they wanted, bought them all school supplies from his last trip to China, and even gave them showers. He loved how much he was involved in their lives, and he never complained.I was three weeks pregnant when this war began. After Oct. 18, the day we lost Eman, Omar, and Zaid, I hated the fact that I was making a new baby while my brother just lost his. I even wished to lose that pregnancy. I felt like a traitor because I had convinced my brother and Eman to have a baby so that their baby would be in the same class as the baby I was having. Eman’s appointment with the gynecologist was on Oct. 8. Read More: Waiting for Iron Man in GazaDays after Eman’s incident, I started to notice some spots, and then a week later, I did lose the baby. The doctor said it must be because of all the stress, fear, and grief I was having. I had a tremendous mix of feelings. I was truly sad for the loss of the baby that I was praying to be a girl, while secretly feeling relieved from the excruciating guilt and feelings of betrayal I was having. I never thought in my whole life that I would even need to pray to God to lose a baby because my brother lost his the way he did. I mean, we were just going to school like any other day.Going through all of these pictures has been agonizing. It took me back to Oct. 18. My brother, who is already traumatized by losing his little family, had to go inside a room full of dead bodies to identify his own sons and wife. They were all covered in dust, sand, and blood. He couldn’t find Zaid at first, but then he recognized his hand. After going through the dead bodies of children, he only found half of his body; only one side of his body was intact—no face, no head at all.The entire process of burying the bodies was gruesome. My husband was there, and he told me what had happened. My brothers Amer, Ali, and Dad arrived home that day speechless, traumatized, and in tears. My husband, Ramadan, said that the doctors first directed them to a room full of dead bodies scattered around. After confirming the bodies, they had to carry the remains personally to another location to complete the paperwork. Then, they had to carry the remains again to their own cars to take them to the cemetery, and of course, they were all buried together in a collective tomb. The hospital was overwhelmed with the number of casualties and dead bodies, which was the reason behind making the families carry the bodies on their own. That day, as I mentioned before, all of Eman’s family died; all 42 of them are buried in the same tomb.No one can tolerate the pain and the mental grievance my brothers and my dad went through that day. My brother’s last farewell to his beloved son was with a hand. He couldn’t hug him, kiss him, whisper something in his ear, or say I love you. He just held a hand to say his last words. How will he ever visit them, speak to them, and plant a tree close to their graves? They don’t even have their own graves. My brother was sleepless for nights. My dad, too. I still hear my dad cry almost every day, saying, “My Zizo, my love was shredded into parts; I could only hug a hand.” What warmed my brother’s heart a little was a dream. His Eman came to him and said, “Don’t worry, Amer, Zizo is ok; he’s as beautiful as he was; he’s not torn to pieces; and when the rockets bombed the house, they were both in my lap.\"When Amoor and Zizo died, a piece of my heart died along with them.  They visited me very often, and I waited for them on Thursdays. They always called me, saying, “We miss you, amto (Auntie). Can we come over?” I can’t begin to imagine the excruciating pain we will go through when we go help my brother with his house. I can’t put myself in my brother’s shoes and think about his pain when he picks up their belongings now that his house, which was once very full, is empty. Going to my parents house will now be heartbreaking. Read more: Gaza Is Being Made UnlivableMy parents and my brother live in the same apartment building. I used to go to my parents house quite frequently just to let my kids play with Omar and Zizo, they adore each other very much and they enjoy watching the same Disney movies together; in the meantime, Eman would make some delicious desserts and treats to enjoy with me and my mother while drinking Nescafe and exchanging gossip while the kids were busy watching Turning Red, Luca or Elemental. I could go on for days, if not years, about how much I loved them. They will always remain in my heart, all three of them.Postscript, in the form of an email. Dec. 18: I left Gaza. Or in a more cliched phrase, I fled with my life along with my two kids and my family. We are now in Egypt. It was very difficult having to leave Ramadan and my in-laws in that burning city. We had the wildest, saddest goodbye. Ramadan said, “Let’s not all die. Go live, and try to make Hamood and Ali forget this ugly war.  I can take this, you can’t. May we all meet again when it’s over. Just promise me to take a good care of the kids. We will be together again, inshallah!” Then he added jokingly, “In this life, or the next.” That joke didn’t make laugh. I wept. I've seen a lot on the way to the border. It was the longest car ride I’ve ever been in.",

        "title_text": "What to Know About the U.S. Coalition Force in the Red Sea",
        "body_text": "The U.S. has launched a 10-country coalition force to patrol the Red Sea and prevent cargo ships from being attacked by Houthi Rebels, who control a portion of territory in Yemen’s northwest. Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, the Houthis have declared their support for the Palestinian cause and began attacking all ships that they believed were stopping at Israeli ports, causing insurance prices on ships passing through the Red Sea to rise dramatically and severely disrupting international trade. The coalition, named Operation Prosperity Guardian, will include Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the Seychelles, and the United Kingdom. The Houthis have been fighting a war with the Saudi-backed government of Yemen since 2014, and seek to control the entirety of Yemen. \"These reckless Houthi attacks are a serious international problem and they demand a firm international response,\" said U.S. defense secretary Lloyd Austin at a virtual meeting with ministers from countries involved in the coalition on Tuesday.A senior Houthi official, Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, responded by writing on X that “America's announcement of the establishment of the Coalition of Shame will not prevent us from continuing our military operations… this is a moral and humanitarian position that we will not abandon, no matter the sacrifices it costs us.”Some of the world’s largest shipping companies, including MSC.Hapag-Lloyd, and Maersk, have all opted for alternative sailing routes around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa to avoid the violence. Read More: The Attacks From Yemen's Houthi Rebels in the Red Sea Are Having a Significant Global ImpactExperts say that the U.S. coalition will likely reduce the Houthi threat, at least in the short run. Sidharth Kaushal, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute who specializes in maritime warfare, says that the countries in the coalition have the defense capabilities to intercept Houthi missiles, but the costs of running such a program indefinitely may make things more complicated. The U.S. has already placed two warships, the USS Carney and USS Mason in the Red Sea, which intercepted 14 drone strikes on Saturday. “In terms of the ability to intercept Houthi drones, I think that there is certainly credible capability there, and we've seen that in how the USS Carney has been able to operate over the last few weeks,” says Kaushal. Kaushal says that as the coalition sends more warships to the area over the coming weeks, the severity of the threat will likely decrease. However, he does warn that such a strategy may not be sustainable in the long run. “I think there is a question about the ability to replenish stocks, in particular air defense interceptors since vertical launch systems can't be replenished at sea,” says Kaushal. In order for these systems to be replenished, the vessel must dock in a friendly country and restock. This could become time consuming and costly in the long run. If the situation ends up becoming ongoing, Kaushal says that it is likely that the U.S. and other members of the coalition may opt to attack Houthi launch infrastructure, as they did previously in 2016 when Houthis launched a Chinese-made cruise missile at a U.S. ship. The U.S. responded with launching Tomahawk cruise missiles against the radar sites that were suspected of being used to launch the missiles. “There is a question of whether something similar becomes more attractive to the allies as they weigh having to expend pretty expensive defensive capabilities,” says Kaushal. ",

        "body_text": "“My one-and-a-half year old child was so scared. He shook so hard I thought he was going to die. Thoughts raced through my head … and then I suddenly had to make a decision to leave my home,” says Majed, a humanitarian worker with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), as Israeli tanks approached his neighborhood in the coastal Al-Shati refugee camp in southern Gaza on Nov. 7. For the past 17 years, Majed has helped those in need and tried to ease the daily challenges of life in besieged Gaza. Now he, too, counts himself among the staggering 85% of Gazans uprooted from their homes. Like the majority of those fleeing, Majed’s initial departure was only the first stage of a terrifying experience that would push his family from one place to the next. “Shelter in Gaza does not really mean anything now. Because there is no safe place anymore,” Majed says. Initially, his family relocated to a school, home to more than 8,000 others all desperately seeking sanctuary. But in a scene that has been repeated thousands of times, that location too became unsafe, and it was once again time to flee. Majed was able to buy some plastic sheeting and found some discarded wood, to improvise a tent. His family—ranging from his 75-year-old father, to his four young children—are now scattered across Rafah and Khan Younis. “Every night, I pray that the next morning comes while I am still alive,” he says. Gaza, with a population roughly the same size as Houston, Texas, has been bombarded from land, sea, and air since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack killed 1,200 people in Israel. At least 19,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, in what has become one of the worst assaults on a civilian population in living memory. Some 1.9 of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced. Read More: From Gaza, Stories of Loss and GriefAs humanitarians, we know that some semblance of a home forms the basis for so much that follows, from health and nutrition, to livelihoods and education. Once it is lost—as has already happened for most Gazans—physical safety, community, health, and a whole range of life-supporting elements start to evaporate.  NRC leads the Shelter Cluster in Gaza, a network of humanitarian organizations providing spaces for people to live in peace time, and which monitors the scale of damage and destruction. It is truly vast: some 70% of Gaza’s homes have been damaged or destroyed. Groups like NRC can provide urgent aid to help keep people alive. But we cannot, as humanitarians, clear the shattered remains of whole cities, raise infrastructure from rubble, or construct multi-story buildings. The updates we receive from our NRC staff in Gaza are often heartbreaking. They tell us how they have gone from being providers of care, to desperately seeking it themselves. Basic materials for shelter are in incredibly short supply, in part because humanitarian aid is being weaponized for political ends as life-saving supplies are being delayed at border crossings. Children ask themselves what they did to lose their homes. Parents ask themselves what future their children could possibly have in a pulverized Gaza. That’s if they manage to survive. In Majed’s case, his brother and family decided to stay in their home in Al-Shati. They were killed in an airstrike in their sleep on Dec. 3. “I couldn’t say goodbye to my brother; I couldn’t bury him,” Majed says. “We have to try and ignore the pain. But even if we live on through this, and return home, there will still be no future. Even if we go back, everything is gone: the memories, the childhood, the basics that make life.”Majed’s story is that of thousands of Palestinian who have lost so much. A small number of Western nations—the U.S. first and foremost among them—have spent years supplying the arms that Israel is now using at an unprecedented clip. When the dust finally settles—whether days, weeks, or months later—they must meet the responsibility for the chaos and destruction caused by this disproportionate bombardment.  The destruction of so much infrastructure has already created a humanitarian catastrophe. But as terrible as it is, it could lead Gaza’s population into as yet unimagined depths of hopelessness in the years to come. ",

        "title_text": "Hamas Leader Visits Cairo Amid Talks of Another Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Swap",
        "body_text": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Hamas’ top leader traveled to Cairo on Wednesday for talks on the war in Gaza, part of a flurry of diplomacy aimed at securing another cease-fire and hostage swap at a moment when the militant group is putting up stiff resistance to Israel’s offensive.Ismail Haniyeh's visit came a day after Hamas fired rockets that set off air raid sirens in central Israel, a show of strength during a 10-week war that has devastated much of northern Gaza, killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians, and driven some 1.9 million — nearly 85% of the population — from their homes.Israel has called on the rest of the world to blacklist Hamas as a terrorist organization, saying it must be eradicated in the wake of its Oct. 7 rampage across southern Israel that triggered the war.But the sides have recently relaunched indirect talks, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, aimed at instituting another cease-fire and freeing more hostages captured in that attack in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.Mobile phone and internet service was down across Gaza again on Wednesday, an outage that could complicate efforts to communicate with Hamas’ leaders inside the territory who went into hiding after Oct. 7.WIDE GAP REMAINS IN TALKS ON HOSTAGESDespite a burst of activity by high-level officials in recent days, the two sides appeared to be far from an agreement.Hamas has said no more hostages will be released until the war ends, and is expected to insist on the release of large numbers of Palestinian prisoners, including high-level militants, for the captives that remain — demands Israel has thus far rejected.Egypt, along with Qatar, helped mediate a weeklong cease-fire in November in which Hamas freed over 100 hostages in exchange for Israel's release of 240 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas and other militants are still holding an estimated 129 captives.Hamas said that Haniyeh — who is believed to be based in Qatar but whose movements are rarely publicized — would discuss the war with Egyptian officials, without providing more details.Ziad Nakhaleh, the leader of the smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, which took part in the Oct. 7 attack and is also holding hostages, said he had also been invited to Egypt for talks and would travel there in the coming days.Egypt, which borders Gaza, is deeply concerned about a potential influx of Palestinian refugees, fearing Israel will not allow them to return.ISRAEL SAYS ‘FINAL CLEARING’ UNDERWAY IN THE NORTHAt least 46 people were killed and more than 100 wounded early Wednesday as Israel continued to bombard the urban Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City, according to Munir al-Bursh, a senior Health Ministry official.In southern Gaza, several women and children were among those brought into Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis after strikes overnight and into Wednesday. A boy could be seen sobbing next to his wounded mother, who was laid out on a stretcher, before being lifted up and placed on her chest.Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Tuesday that Israeli forces were entering Hamas’ tunnel network in northern Gaza as part of a “final clearing” of militants from the region. The densely built urban north — including Gaza City, the territory's largest — has seen ferocious fighting, with Palestinian health officials reporting dozens of people killed in bombardment in recent days.Gallant said that in southern Gaza, where the military launched a ground incursion focused on Khan Younis in early December, operations will take “months.\"The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday the death toll since the start of the war had risen to more than 19,600. It does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack.Israel’s military says 134 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. Israel says it has killed some 7,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields when it fights in residential areas.UN MEMBERS STILL PUSHING US ON AID RESOLUTIONU.N. Security Council members are negotiating an Arab-sponsored resolution to halt the fighting in some way to allow for an increase in desperately needed humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. A vote on the resolution, first scheduled for Monday, was pushed back again until Wednesday as talks continued in the hopes of getting the U.S. to abstain or vote “yes” on the resolution after it vetoed an earlier cease-fire call.France, the United Kingdom and Germany — some of Israel’s closest allies — joined global calls for a cease-fire over the weekend. In Israel, protesters have called for negotiations with Hamas to facilitate the release of scores of hostages still held by the group.Israel says it will keep fighting until it has removed Hamas from power, dismantled its armed wing and returned all the hostages. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has called on Israel to take greater steps to spare civilians but has continued to provide diplomatic and military support for the offensive.",

        "title_text": "Inside the Israel-Hamas Information War",
        "body_text": "One of the most important people in Israel right now is a 22-year-old military press officer. In recent weeks, Masha Michelson has become the face of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on social media. With no combat training, Michelson has been trailing Israeli troops in Gaza to document the war from their point of view. On Nov. 19, Michelson, garbed in green military fatigues and a flak jacket, filmed a night-vision tour of the tunnel shafts under Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City—evidence, she said, of a subterranean terrorist command center where they had found a cache of weapons—and posted it through the IDF's accounts on TikTok, Instagram, and X, platforms where young audiences are increasingly turning against Israel’s war to destroy Hamas. “When you need to address the world,” Michelson tells TIME, “they're more likely to listen to someone who looks like them.”Getting the world to listen is one thing; convincing people is another. Four days before Michelson’s tunnel tour, Israel had concluded a days-long siege of Al-Shifa. The raid forced thousands of sick and injured patients and the doctors and nurses caring for them to evacuate the facility, reportedly resulting in the death of at least six premature babies. To Israel's critics, it was the latest example of the cost in innocent lives of its offensive. The more than two-month-long bombardment has killed at least 20,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Nearly two million Palestinians have been displaced from their homes. The resulting humanitarian crisis has left the beleaguered coastal enclave all but uninhabitable. Each day, grisly images from the ground in Gaza emerge: mothers and fathers holding their dead children, body parts dug out of the rubble.To Israel and its supporters, the civilian casualties are a tragic but necessary price that must be paid for the security of the nation-state created after the Holocaust to ensure a haven for Jews in their ancestral homeland. Israel launched the war after Hamas infiltrated Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people including children and the elderly, taking hundreds of hostages, and committing atrocities including rape. Since then, the group has vowed to repeat the attack. Israel is doing everything it can to avoid the deaths of innocents, its leaders say, but they are unavoidable when Hamas forces use virtually the entire Gazan population, including those in hospitals, as human shields. “How can we fight Hamas without having civilian casualties?” says Yaakov Amidror, a former IDF general. And without destroying Hamas, Israeli leadership argues, you condemn the country to more massacres and send a message to other hostile powers in the region, like Iran, that terrorism works. “That cannot be the future of the Middle East,” agrees Dennis Ross, a former Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiator who served in multiple U.S. administrations.Much of the world is not convinced. Social media is flooded with wrenching scenes of death and destruction, captured and shared by charismatic citizen journalists who have gained massive audiences with their eyewitness accounts of the war. Videos and images from the ground have been amplified by Hamas sympathizers and state-affiliated Chinese, Russian, and Iranian accounts, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that monitors online disinformation. A surge of global antisemitism, from college campuses to the halls of power, seeks to discredit and negate Israel's security concerns. At the same time, some Israeli government officials have undercut their message that the war is designed to minimize civilian casualties by calling for Gaza to be “flattened,” “destroyed\" and \"erased.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared the war effort to the biblical story of Amalek, when God tells King Saul to kill every person, including women and children, in the rival nation to ancient Israel. Amid cratering international support for Israel’s war, there is little debate over which side is winning the battle for hearts and minds. The number of Americans who want the U.S. to take Israel’s side has dropped from 43% in October to 37% in November, according to a survey conducted by the University of Maryland and Ipsos. After tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in European capitals, some of the continent’s most prominent leaders dialed back their full-fledged embrace of the Israeli campaign, with French President Emmanuel Macron calling on Israel to halt the hostilities. The U.S. remains the only U.N. Security Council member to vote against a call for an immediate ceasefire. And now even the Biden administration, Israel’s staunchest ally and biggest supplier of military aid, is pushing the country to scale back its offensive in a matter of weeks. “They have to be careful,” President Joe Biden said on Dec. 11. \"The whole world’s public opinion can shift overnight. We can’t let that happen.”Interviews with dozens of current and former Israeli and U.S. officials reveal a recognition of the accelerating loss of global public support, and a scramble by the nation’s leaders in response. Behind the social media messaging of spokespeople like Michelson lies a rapidly growing operation to convince the world that Israel is fighting for nothing less than its own survival and is doing what it can to avoid civilian casualties. The IDF’s international communications office has doubled in size to more than 200 people. The IDF has taken reporters and prominent supporters—from Elon Musk and Jerry Seinfeld to a convoy of TikTok influencers—to visit the kibbutzim that became killing fields, in hopes of reminding the world of the scale and depravity of the Oct. 7 attack. The Israeli government has spent millions of dollars on online ad campaigns on platforms ranging from YouTube to the popular online game Angry Birds. Israeli embassies around the world continue to screen for journalists and politicians a 43-minute video of the Hamas atrocities, much of it filmed on the terrorists’ own cameras.There are signs that the effort is working, to an extent; a Pew Research poll from early December found that 65% of Americans think Hamas is mostly responsible for the war. As the fighting in Gaza moves south and the U.S. pushes its ally to wind down the ground operation, the information war about the war is becoming more important than ever. If Israel wins the military battle but loses the war for worldwide public opinion, it could threaten the durability of American support, damage Israel’s ability to forge and maintain peace with its Arab neighbors, shape the perception of the Jewish state for the next generation, and put the safety and security of the Jewish diaspora at risk. “The stakes of the information war,” says Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, “are the stakes of the war itself.”Three days after the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli officials brought a group of international journalists to Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where Hamas killed more than 50 people. The site was still an active crime scene. Corpses were everywhere: Israeli victims wrapped in body bags, Hamas fighters lying where they fell. Military officers led reporters into homes stained with blood, some still filled with mutilated bodies and the charred remains of burned victims. “You could smell the death in the air,” recalls Anshel Pfeffer, a veteran Israeli reporter who writes for The Economist. The security-conscious IDF had never before allowed the media to explore the site of a terrorist attack with no limitations, with fighting ongoing only a few miles away. The move was part of a strategy to lay the groundwork for the war through hasbara—Israel’s term for public advocacy. In Hebrew, it means “to explain.”  Showing the scope and severity of the atrocities would expand the “window of legitimacy” for an invasion of Gaza and the inevitably horrific scenes to follow, Israeli officials said. “It was just like Eisenhower, when he discovered Bergen-Belsen,” says Richard Hecht, the IDF’s international spokesman, invoking the U.S. decision to bring journalists to the liberated Nazi concentration camp in 1945. Reminding the world what happened on Oct. 7 has been at the heart of Israel’s effort to explain its war effort to an increasingly skeptical public. On social media, at pro-Israel solidarity rallies, and in private meetings with politicians, journalists, and business leaders, officials have highlighted the massacre as an indelible tragedy in Jewish history. The sheer barbarism of it, which included the rape and mutilation of women and the murder of babies, is one reason Israel is determined to eliminate Hamas.  If Israel allows Hamas to survive after perpetrating a pogrom, Israel's leaders reason, it’s only a matter of time until Hamas or other enemies do it again. “There is no future for the Jewish people or the State of Israel in a world where genocidal terrorists can invade Israel and abduct babies from their beds, burn whole families alive, torture children in front of their parents and get away with impunity,” says Levy. But the hasbara effort is struggling in the face of massive civilian casualties in Gaza. The Islamist group embeds its military installations within densely populated neighborhoods in part to increase civilian casualties, Israeli officials say. \"They seek to maximize casualties on their side, because it's effective,\" says Ophir Falk, a foreign policy adviser to Netanyahu. \"If there are a lot of civilian casualties on their side, it's easier for them to win the propaganda war.\" Hamas officials all but acknowledge the strategy, saying they launched the Oct. 7 attack to provoke a major military response by Israel they expected would produce civilian casualties. Israel had been on the cusp of a diplomatic agreement to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia that would have marginalized Iran and its proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Hamas was determined to stop it. “We planned for this because Israel thinks it can make peace with anyone, it can make normalization with any country, it can oppress the Palestinians, so we decided to shock the Israelis in order to wake up others,” Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, told TIME in the aftermath of the attack. “Now they want to destroy everything. This will cost them. It will cost them very much.”Some Israeli officials have made statements that have played into that strategy by Hamas. In the first days of the offensive, Israeli military leaders flatly asserted that \"the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy\"; Air Force officers told reporters that \"we're not being surgical.\" Meanwhile, the IDF’s punishing air and ground campaign rallied millions of young people whose views have been shaped less by the Holocaust than by the decades of Israeli dominion over Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. TikTok and other platforms have become bastions of pro-Palestinian content to youthful audiences who see Israel not as the victim in the conflict but as the oppressor. On Facebook, there were 39 times more #freepalestine posts than #standwithisrael posts. “We were surprised not just on the physical fence on Oct. 7,” says Amichai Chikli, Israel’s Minister for Diaspora Affairs, “but also on the digital fence that we didn’t have.”Realizing that graphic footage from Gaza was overtaking the Oct. 7 massacre, the IDF began to show the video compilation of footage from the attack, captured on Israeli security cameras and Hamas body cams and phones. After showing it to journalists in Tel Aviv, Israeli officials screened it at embassies and consulates across the globe. One such viewing in Washington on Oct. 30 showed how Hamas militants murdered with glee; in one sequence, the IDF intercepts a recorded phone call a terrorist made to his parents on a victim’s WhatsApp in which he brags about killing 10 Jews. The IDF has also initiated a campaign to publicize its humanitarian efforts such as allowing aid shipments into Gaza and transporting sick babies to Israeli hospitals. “If we’re creating humanitarian relief, it will give us the time that we need to dismantle Hamas,” Hecht says. “That’s the logic. My goal and my operation is to create international legitimacy.” Israeli government and military social media channels have posted videos, ads, and graphics that highlight their distribution of Arabic leaflets, phone calls, and text messages warning civilians to flee certain areas. In one TikTok video, the IDF posted raw footage showing officers deciding to hold off on striking a target due to the large number of people, including children, at the site. The IDF has recruited reservists and media experts, doubling its international press office that communicates in 14 languages. Other units, such as the National Public Diplomacy Directorate, have brought in new spokespeople, such as Levy, to help make the case to the world.Part of Israel’s strategy has been to argue it has a legitimate need to attack civilian targets. That was most resonant on Nov. 15, when Israel raided Shifa hospital. The Israeli wartime cabinet held multiple meetings before green-lighting the strike, according to Falk. “We have to be absolutely sure, 100%, that the hospital is being used as a control center for terrorists,” says Falk. Under normal circumstances, Israel would bomb a Hamas stronghold, Falk adds, but decided on a ground assault, putting its troops at risk, because it recognized the hospital had civilian patients. “It was important to show the world what was going on,” Falk says of exposing Hamas’ activity at Shifa. “That is part of the information war.”Once the IDF took over the hospital, they began filming videos inside the tunnels, with officers walking viewers through evidence including weapons and explosives allegedly left behind by Hamas fighters. The IDF then made its case across social media, in a direct address to the audiences most repulsed by the Israeli military campaign. “It was crucial to the operation of the Oct. 7 attack,” Michelson says of the complex, citing the accounts of hostages who were brought back to Shifa and the items from kibbutzim found on the premises. U.S. officials agree the tunnels were used for Hamas command and control. But many remain unconvinced. A recent Washington Post investigation concluded that the IDF had failed to prove that Hamas used the hospitals militarily.  Another aspect of the strategy has been an attempt to get the world to identify with Hamas’s victims. “Imagine it was your grandmother being kidnapped from her home and paraded around by terrorists,” Israel’s social media account asked in a video on Nov. 7. In another, dramatized by actors, a woman seeking to report sexual violence by Hamas militants was met with indifference by the international community.  Israel’s Foreign Ministry paid for more than $2 million in online ads, containing footage of the Oct. 7 attack. \"Israel is fighting battles on many fronts, but the social media front is particularly aggressive,” says Fleur Hassan Nahoum, Jerusalem’s deputy mayor.  “And we are painfully outnumbered.” In early December, senior developers from Tel Aviv’s top tech companies met with Israeli government officials and international communications consultants for a “Hasbara Hackathon” to develop digital tools including a sentiment meter to test whether IDF messaging is resonating with online audiences abroad. “It shows us if the response is positive or negative,” says Jonathan Sagir, one of its organizers. “If the IDF spokesman makes a mistake or the message backfires, it gives us the ability to change it before it spreads too much too fast.” But it’s an effort that can sometimes run up against the Israelis' own covert messaging operations. Since the start of the war, Israel has deployed its psyops operation known as the “Influence Unit”—a small but secretive office run out of the IDF that plants stories in the press to shape the perception of the war and send signals to the enemy, senior Israeli officials tell TIME. In some cases, the unit’s tactics can undermine the Israeli government’s hasbara effort. On Dec. 10, it released photographs of Palestinian men, whom the IDF claimed were Hamas terrorists, stripped in their underwear and surrendering to Israeli military forces. It was designed, the Israeli official says, to show Israel winning on the battlefield and to demoralize Hamas members with images of their own men giving up, even though they knew it would come with scathing critiques from the international community and bruising headlines. Says the senior IDF official: “It’s a condemnation that we can suffer.”Part of the challenge of the organized Israeli military effort is that it is competing with spontaneous global reaction to the horrors of war suffered by innocent civilians. Before Oct. 7, Bisan Owda’s Instagram looked like most 25-year-olds: selfies, pictures of her cats, photos out with friends. Since then, her feed has morphed into a harrowing video diary from Gaza. In a shaky video posted Nov. 3, hundreds of panicked people flood into a courtyard, some carrying bloodied people in their arms. \"It's a massacre, there are thousands of people around,\" Owda cries out as she pans the camera to show the aftermath of an Israeli strike. \"I was there two minutes ago. It could be me.\"Owda, whose account has gained 3.6 million followers since the war’s outbreak, is one of many young Gazans whose social media has provided vast international audiences with a visceral daily look at life on the ground. They have chronicled the deaths of friends and family, the obliteration of homes and schools, their desperate scramble for medical supplies and food, and their journey to flee south with hundreds of thousands of other displaced Palestinians. Their posts receive tens of thousands of comments a day, with many anxiously checking to make sure they are still alive. “Why do we Palestinians have to film our own country getting bombed and our own people getting killed,” asked Plestia Alaqad, a 22-year-old freelance journalist whose Instagram account has  4.6 million followers, on Nov. 4, “just for the world to watch silently?”The proliferation of smartphones inside Gaza’s dense urban environment means that Israel’s military operation has generated more real-time data than any contemporary war, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, analysts say. They are, for the Israel-Hamas conflict, what television cameras were in the Vietnam era: a new medium through which the world is confronted with the horrors of war.In that sense, Hamas' willingness to sacrifice civilian Palestinians for the larger cause of building anti-Israel sentiment worldwide has succeeded beyond measure. Between 61% and 68% of Palestinians killed in Gaza were non-combatants, according to a recent analysis by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, a far higher proportion of civilian casualties than in previous combat operations in the Gaza Strip. The deluge of graphic content reporting on those casualties has subsequently been exploited by other opponents of Israel and the U.S. in a variety of ways. Hamas propagandists, and state actors like Russia, China and Iran have unleashed a systematic effort to amplify the images and posts through bots and state-affiliated accounts. Some 40,000 fake accounts on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X pumped out hundreds of posts per day with pro-Hamas narratives after Oct. 7, according to the Tel Aviv-based social media intelligence company, Cyabra. Many of the accounts seem to have been created more than a year before the attack but were activated after Oct. 7, Cyabra claims. In online conversations about Israel and Hamas after the attack, more than 25% of the accounts engaging in the debate were fake, according to the firm’s analysis. \"In terms of scale,” says Rafi Mendelson, vice president of Cyabra, “what we're seeing is definitely unprecedented.”Accounts tied to China, Iran, and Russia have sought to capitalize on the conflict to spread anti-Western propaganda. Iranian state-linked accounts have glorified Hamas’s attack as an act of resistance against a “neo-colonial” power, and amplified narratives accusing the U.S. of being responsible for Palestinian suffering, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Russian and Chinese government accounts have promoted similar content, accusing Western countries of turning a blind eye to alleged Israeli war crimes, the think tank says. Compounding the problem for Israel has been the speed with which Hamas and its supporters put out misinformation, leaving the Israelis often playing catch up in the hours it can sometimes take to respond to claims on the internet. “Our main challenge is, we have to verify facts,” Falk says. “Speed matters today, because there’s so many out there on social media.”Among social media channels, TikTok in particular has been dominated by pro-Palestinian content. For every pro-Israel post on TikTok, there have been 36 pro-Palestinian posts, according to an analysis of hashtags shared with TIME by statistician Anthony Goldbloom, a former chief executive of Kaggle, a data science company now part of Google. Videos posted by young Israeli soldiers seeming to mock Palestinians, smashing childrens’ certificates in Gazan schools or filming themselves throwing a stun grenade into a mosque have been widely amplified to depict the IDF as callous. (The soldier involved in the latter incident was suspended after the video went viral).The war in Gaza has fueled a wave of antisemitism that was already on the rise. Across the world, people have been filmed tearing down posters of Jewish hostages held in Gaza; student groups and professors have written letters supporting the Oct. 7 massacre; and synagogues have been vandalized with Nazi insignia. In November, hundreds of people stormed an airport in Dagestan chanting antisemitic slogans and waving Palestinian flags while looking for passengers coming off a flight from Tel Aviv. To scholars, the war has become a masquerade to advance expressions of Jew hatred. “When Molotov cocktails are thrown in synagogues, when Holocaust memorials are defaced, when marchers chant against the Jews, when Jewish children are harassed, that’s not fighting for Palestinian rights,” says Deborah Lipstadt, the Biden Administration’s Special Envoy to Combat Anti-Semitism. “That’s antisemitism, pure and simple.”Israel has also had to contend with its own self-inflicted mistakes. On Oct. 17, major news organizations took Hamas’s word that an explosion outside a hospital was from an Israeli air strike, but U.S. and Israeli intelligence found it was from a misfired Palestinian Islamic Jihad missile. The incident vindicated Israel, but then the country stepped on its own foot. Official Israeli media accounts shared a video of a rocket blazing out of Gaza toward Israel then plummeting midair back into Gaza City. It seemed exculpatory for Israel. But the video was from August 2022. In a WhatsApp group used by more than 50 Israeli communications officials since the war’s outbreak, one member shared an unverified video they saw on the internet, according to sources familiar with the incident. Others were soon posting it on official channels, only to be forced to remove it once it became clear the clip was from a previous conflict. “We do make mistakes,” says Lior Haiat, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “When we do, we take it off. We understand that our integrity is our main weapon.”Analysts say Israel’s posting of false or disputed content has eroded trust in the information it has disseminated. A video posted by Israel’s Arabic account, which purported to show a Palestinian nurse condemning Hamas for taking over the Al-Shifa hospital compound, was widely ridiculed for its odd accent, theatrical props, and scripted IDF talking points. (It was deleted soon after). Official Israel accounts have also posted photos and videos of what they falsely claimed were Palestinian “crisis actors” faking injuries, which turned out to be footage from an old Lebanese film. “We really risk regional escalation,” says Alessandro Accorsi, an analyst at International Crisis Group, a think tank in Brussels, “if there is growing doubt over whether Israel’s military is putting out credible information.” One tragedy of Israel’s war in Gaza is that its central goal—to secure a safe place for Jews—is likely to be undermined by the horrors inflicted on innocent Palestinians. That is especially true in America, Israel’s closest ally. While most Americans still sympathize with Israel, the number who disapprove of its military actions in Gaza has increased, according to recent polls. Protests in solidarity with Palestinians are not slowing down, and more and more Democratic lawmakers have voiced their concerns about the large amounts of funding Congress has approved for Israel with few strings attached. (The current memorandum of understanding that guarantees Israel $3.8 billion annually in military aid expires in 2026.) That shift isn’t coming out of nowhere. Last March, Gallup found for the first time in its annual polling that self-identified Democrats sympathized more with the Palestinians than with Israel, 49% versus 38%.There has also been an unprecedented level of internal rebellion in the Biden administration, with dissent cables, internal petitions, and open letters from employees at the State Department, White House and Capitol Hill showing widening concerns that America’s reputation could be permanently damaged by its support for Israel's war. “We're having an almost Vietnam-level movement, a young generation versus the old generation,” says Shibley Telhami, a Palestinian-American scholar and professor at the University of Maryland. In a recent NBC poll, 70% of voters between the ages of 18 to 34 said they disapproved of Biden’s handling of the war. Israeli officials say they fear long-term consequences among younger U.S. audiences who will become the next generation of lawmakers. “I’m talking about the people who are not yet in the circle of decision-makers,” Haiat says.  “People who are on the verge of getting to Congress.”For now, though, Israel’s leaders seem determined to focus on the threat immediately in front of them—Hamas—and less on what may lie ahead. No one is more aware of the risks of that approach than Israeli public affairs officers. With Israel facing growing pressure to define a viable endgame for the war, its efforts to reach audiences around the world have become more urgent. “It's important that the war ends with Israel enjoying the same support from the free world” as it did before, says Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson. But while the military war between Israel and Hamas may end within weeks or months, the information war is likely to continue long after the last tank rolls out of Gaza. “We're used to a reality where history is written by the victor,\" says Michelson, the 22-year-old IDF press aide. \"It's not the case anymore.\"",

        "title_text": "How 2024 Will Be a Watershed Climate Moment for China",
        "body_text": "China has undergone a drastic transformation in recent decades, from a poor Global South country into the world’s second largest economy, lifting millions out of poverty in the process. But with that growth has come plenty of emissions. And yet, China is on the brink of a new era that will have a major impact on the planet’s future.According to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CERA), a Finnish think tank, China's emissions may have peaked in 2023. Its economy is slowing down systemically, its construction sector is weak, wind and solar energy are growing rapidly, and hydro-power output will rebound after a series of droughts. As a result, China’s carbon emissions are expected to decrease in 2024, a trend that looks set to continue in the years that follow.The International Energy Agency reached a similar conclusion in its World Energy Outlook 2023 report. The report predicts that global greenhouse gas emissions could peak in 2025, partially driven by what’s happening in China.If still differing on exactly when China will peak, analysts are increasingly of the view that China’s carbon peak point is imminent. This should help shift the conversation to the more important question: where will China go from here?China’s climate policymakers appear to be behind their emission curve. In 2021, the country updated its original Paris Agreement pledge, saying its emission peak would go from around 2030 to “before” it. But Beijing has thus far resisted moving its peak year target closer to 2025.Beijing’s conservatism can be attributed in part to domestic politics and its unique national experience. The country’s bureaucratic culture stands for hesitancy toward the liability of unfulfilled promises. This leads to strong reluctance toward high-profile pledges with uncertainty for delivery. Peak year calls for special caution as it can only be confirmed retrospectively, compared to an emission reduction target tied to a specific year.But China must nevertheless prepare for an emissions peak to successfully manage it. Fortunately, there are signs that Beijing is getting its head around the issue. At the recently concluded U.N. Climate Change Summit, COP28, in Dubai, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua vowed to clarify which year and at what level China’s emissions will peak. A few weeks before that, the phrase “post-peaking” made it into a high-profile climate agreement between the U.S. and China in Sunnylands, California. This was the first time it appeared in any Chinese official document or any of its agreements signed with other countries. Its inclusion suggests that Chinese officials are becoming more accepting of the idea of reaching the tipping point soon.Read More: Why Renewables Are Key to COP28 SuccessBeijing’s ultimate answer lies in its 2035 climate targets. All countries must prepare these pledges next year. The Paris Agreement requires them by early 2025. Given China has committed to peak before 2030, its 2035 goals will feature net emission reduction by default. What China pledges to the U.N. over the coming year will outline the contours of the descent through to 2035, and lay the groundwork for Beijing’s broader goal of reaching Net Zero by 2060.The space of the Chinese imagination—be it a long plateau post-peak or, preferably, a persistent decline—will matter a great deal for the global effort of combating climate change. There are good reasons to be bold. Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a consultancy, finds China is the only major emitter that will be able to triple its renewable energy installation by the end of this decade. This will be a critical step to force the country away from its addiction to coal. The rapid renewable energy uptake, together with its world-leading electric vehicle and battery storage industries, are becoming major engines for growth in an otherwise weak economy. This shift away from the high-carbon and fossil-fuel energy model provides hope for sustainable growth and meaningful emission reduction over the next decade and beyond. Read More: China’s Electric Vehicle Battery KingChina should therefore dare to imagine. After all, defying expectations, including some of its own, has been the China story. The country has compressed the social and economic transformations that took industrialized countries more than a century into that of one generation. Now China needs to join the global trend of demonstrating that decarbonization and prosperity can be achieved at the same time.Peak emissions in China may be a major turning point, but it pales in front of the monumental challenge of achieving rapid emissions reductions. Still, the milestone should give hope for a global transition away from fossil fuels, as called for by COP28. Welcome to the post-peaking world.",

        "title_text": "At Least 14 People Killed After Mass Shooting at a Prague University: Authorities",
        "body_text": "PRAGUE — A lone gunman opened fire Thursday in a university building in downtown Prague, killing at least 14 people and injuring more than 20 in the Czech Republic’s worst mass shooting, police and the city’s rescue service said.The bloodshed took place in the philosophy department building of Charles University, where the shooter was a student, Prague Police Chief Martin Vondrasek said. The gunman also died, authorities said. His name has not been released.Vondrasek said in the evening that 14 people had died and 25 were injured, after earlier reporting that 15 had died and 24 were hurt. He didn't explain the change. Authorities warned that the death toll could rise.Police gave no details about the victims or a possible motive for the shooting at the building located near the Vltava River in Jan Palach Square. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said investigators do not suspect a link to any extremist ideology or groups.Vondrasek said police believe the gunman killed his father earlier Thursday in his hometown of Hostoun, just west of Prague, and that he had also been planning to kill himself. He didn't elaborate.Later Thursday, Vondrasek said that based on a search of his home, the gunman was also suspected in the killing of another man and his 2-month-old daughter Dec. 15, in the east of Prague.The chief described the shooter as an excellent student with no criminal record, but didn't provide any other information.The gunman suffered “devastating injuries” but it wasn't clear if he killed himself or was shot to death in an exchange of gunfire with officers, Vondrasek said, adding that there was \"nothing to suggest that he had an accomplice.”The shooter legally owned several guns — police said he was heavily armed Thursday and was carrying a lot of ammunition — and that what he did was “well thought out, a horrible act,” Vondrasek said.University authorities said they would tighten security in university buildings with immediate effect.“We mourn the loss of life of members of our university community, express our deepest condolences to all the bereaved and our thoughts are with all those affected by the tragedy,” Charles University said in a statement.The building where the shooting took place is near the Vltava River in Jan Palach Square, a busy tourist area in Prague's Old Town. It is just a few minutes' walk from the picturesque Old Town Square, a major tourist attraction where a popular Christmas market attracts thousands of visitors.The government quickly sought to quell concerns that the massacre was back by foreign interests.“There's no indication that it has anything to do with international terrorism,” Rakusan said.“It's a horrible crime, something the Czech Republic has never experienced,” he said.Pavel Nedoma, the director of the nearby Rudolfinum Gallery, said he watched from a window as a person standing on a balcony of the building fired a gun.Authorities evacuated everyone from the building and police said they were still searching the area, including the balcony, for explosives.The building forms part of the square and faces a bridge across the river with a view of Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency. President Petr Pavel said he was “shocked” by what happened and offered his condolences to the relatives of the victims, as did leaders of Germany, France and Slovakia, the European Union and Israel.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sent a message of condolence.“The president and the first lady are praying for the families who lost loved ones and everyone else who has been affected by this senseless act of violence,” Jean-Pierre said. “On behalf of the United States, we send our condolences and also wish the survivors of this tragic event a speedy recovery.”The Czech government planned to meet later Thursday for an emergency session to discuss the shooting.Previously, the nation’s worst mass shooting was in 2015, when a gunman opened fire in the southeastern town of Uhersky Brod, killing eight before fatally shooting himself.On Thursday, where tourists, students and others would normally be enjoying the view of the iconic monument, chaos and terror instead took hold. Police vehicles and ambulances sped across the bridge with their sirens wailing. Officers sealed off the empty square.Some video footage showed people being evacuated from the building and others trying to hide behind a wall.Ivo Havranek, a diving instructor, said he was near the building when he heard a shot ring out, but he didn't quite believe that was what he had heard.“Only at the moment when I saw the fully equipped riot police with bulletproof vests and shields, it looked to me that I had found myself in a movie,\" Havranek said. \"But it was obvious that nobody was shooting a movie.\"",

        "title_text": "The Prague Mass Shooting Is One of the Czech Republic’s Deadliest. Here’s What to Know About Its Gun Laws",
        "body_text": "At least 14 people were killed and another 25 injured after a gunman opened fire on Thursday at Charles University  in Prague, according to local police. The shooting, in a country where gun violence is rare, is the country’s deadliest in modern history. “It’s a horrible crime, something the Czech Republic has never experienced,” said Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan on Tuesday. International firearm injury prevention organization Gunpolicy.org reports that, in 2019—the last year with available gun violence data on their site—there were 195 total gun deaths in the Czech Republic, a country of 10.8 million people. In 2018, the number stood at 170, and the year before that, there were 174 deaths. By contrast, the United States has reported more than 15,000 firearm deaths in 2019, excluding suicides, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Gun laws in the Czech Republic are generally lax compared to other European nations, though citizens still have to pass a multi-part test, background check and health clearance to obtain a firearm.   Czech authorities revealed the gunman involved in Thursday’s shooting legally owned several guns. They added that the act was premeditated, calling it a “well thought out, horrible act,” per the AP. Police have not released information about the suspect’s connection to any terrorist organization, or a possible motive.Prior to Thursday, the country’s deadliest mass mass shooting in modern history was in 2015, when a shooter took eight lives before fatally shooting himself. At least one other mass killing has occurred since, when a gunman killed six people in a hospital waiting room in 2019, according to Reuters. There are more than 1 million registered weapons in the Czech Republic, according to 2022 police data. The Czech Republic has the constitutional right to bear arms and allows citizens to carry concealed weapons for self-defense, though the process for actually obtaining a weapon involves multiple steps. Some of the standards to obtain a gun license vary. Everyone has to undergo a background and health check, though police can opt to take someone’s weapon away if they appear to have mental health problems. (That law was passed after the 2015 mass shooting. The gunman had shown signs of mental health issues prior.)People must also take a multiple choice question quiz—of which 30 questions are taken from a possible 501 that people can study from. The test may be more or less difficult for some based on the type of license they want to obtain. For instance, people who are attempting to get their concealed carry license can only get one question wrong, meaning that about 2 in 5 people do not pass, the Washington Post reports. Following the written portion of the test, citizens also have to show that they can shoot a firearm well. They have to be able to describe the different parts of the gun for the exam and show that they know how to safely store their weapon. People are also not allowed to own guns if they have a criminal record.Reports show a slight increase in obtaining a gun license in the country since Russia first invaded Ukraine, but with such precautions in place, gun violence is still incredibly rare.\"We always thought that this was a thing that did not concern us,\" Prague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda said to Czech Television. “Now it turns out that, unfortunately, our world is also changing and the problem of the individual shooter is emerging here as well.”",

        "body_text": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip — More than half a million people in Gaza — a quarter of the population — are starving, according to a report Thursday by the United Nations and other agencies, highlighting the humanitarian crisis caused by Israel’s bombardment and siege on the territory in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.The extent of the population’s hunger eclipsed even the near-famines in Afghanistan and Yemen of recent years, according to figures in the report. The report warned that the risk of famine is “increasing each day,” blaming the hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza.Read More: Gaza Is Being Made Unlivable“It doesn’t get any worse,” said Arif Husain, chief economist for the U.N.’s World Food Program. “I have never seen something at the scale that is happening in Gaza. And at this speed.”Israel says it is in the final stages of clearing out Hamas militants from northern Gaza, but that months of fighting lie ahead in the south.The war sparked by Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 rampage and hostage-taking in Israel has killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians. Some 1.9 million Gaza residents — more than 80% of the population — have been driven from their homes, and many of them are crammed into U.N. shelters.The war has also pushed Gaza’s health sector into collapse. Only nine of its 36 health facilities are still partially functioning, all located in the south, according to the World Health Organization. On Thursday, WHO relief workers reported “unbearable” scenes in two hospitals they visited in northern Gaza: Bedridden patients with untreated wounds crying out for water, the few remaining doctors and nurses having no supplies, and bodies being lined up in the courtyard.Bombardment and fighting continued Thursday, and internet and communications that had been knocked out for several days gradually began to return across the territory.U.N. Security Council members again delayed a vote on a now-watered down Arab-sponsored resolution for a halt in combat to allow for increased aid deliveries. A vote, initially set for Monday, has been delayed each day since then. The United States now supports the resolution, but other council members said that because of the significant changes, they needed to consult their capitals before a vote, which is now expected on Friday.Other countries support a stronger text in the resolution that would include the now-eliminated call for the urgent suspension of hostilities between Israel and Hamas.Instead, the wording now calls “for urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.” The steps are not defined, but diplomats said, if adopted, this would mark the council’s first reference to a cessation of hostilities.Thursday’s report from the U.N. on the hunger in Gaza underscored the failure of weeks of U.S. efforts to ensure greater aid reaches Palestinians.At the start of the war, Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, medicine and fuel into the territory. After U.S. pressure, it allowed a trickle of aid in through Egypt. But U.N. agencies say only 10% of Gaza's food needs has been entering for weeks.This week, Israel began allowing aid to enter Gaza through its Kerem Shalom crossing, which boosted the number of trucks entering from around 100 a day to around 190 on Wednesday, according to the U.N. But an Israeli strike Thursday morning hit the Palestinian side of the crossing, forcing the U.N. to stop its pickups of aid there, according to Juliette Touma, spokesperson of UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.At least four staff members at the crossing were killed, a nearby hospital reported. The Israeli military said it struck militants in the area.Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Israel has been working to increase its inspection of aid trucks to 300 or 400 a day, and blamed the U.N. for failures in delivery. The amount of aid could triple “if the U.N., instead of complaining all day, would do its job,” he said, without elaborating on what more the U.N. should be doing.Egypt’s Rafah crossing has limited capacity for trucks to cross. U.N. officials say delivery of aid within much of Gaza has become difficult or impossible because of fighting, and more than 130 U.N. personnel have been killed.The report released Thursday by 23 U.N. and nongovernmental agencies found that the entire population in Gaza is in food crisis, with 576,600 at catastrophic or starvation levels. “It is a situation where pretty much everybody in Gaza is hungry,” Husain, the World Food Program economist, said.“People are very, very close to large outbreaks of disease because their immune systems have become so weak because they don’t have enough nourishment,” he said.Hundreds of people lined up Thursday at a soup kitchen in the southern Gaza town of Rafah, waving cups and pots as they waited for soup to be served from huge vats hanging over wood fires. Rafah, by the Egypt border, is one of the few places that receives regular aid deliveries.Aya Barbakh, who's been displaced by the war, said she comes every day for food.“Let us be in comfort like other people. We see people dying every day, and we want to die like them. We have been insulted and humiliated,” she said.Mahmoud al-Qishawi, with the American charity Pious Projects that runs the kitchen, said there’s no fuel to cook with, so they have to search around the neighborhood for wood to burn. “There’s a huge number of families and we don’t have food that is enough for them.”Israel has vowed to continue the offensive until it destroys Hamas’ military capabilities and returns scores of hostages captured by Palestinian militants during their Oct. 7 rampage. Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and captured around 240 others.Hamas fired a barrage of rockets at central Israel Thursday, showing its military capabilities remain formidable. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.The United States has continued to support Israel’s campaign while also urging greater efforts to protect civilians. The U.S. wants Israel to shift to more targeted operations aimed at Hamas leaders and the group’s tunnel network.The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday the death toll since the start of the war had risen to more than 19,600. It does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.On Wednesday, the WHO delivered supplies to Ahli and Shifa hospitals in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops have demolished vast swaths of the city while fighting Hamas militants.Israeli forces raided a series of health facilities in the north in recent weeks, detaining men for interrogation and expelling others. On Thursday, troops stormed the Palestinian Red Crescent's ambulance center in the Jabaliya refugee camp, taking away paramedics and ambulance crews, the group said.In some health facilities, patients who are unable to be moved remain, along with a skeleton staff who can do little beyond first aid, according to U.N. and health officials.Read More: The Horrors I’ve Seen Treating Patients at Gaza’s Remaining HospitalsAhli Hospital is “a place where people are waiting to die,” said Sean Casey, a member of the WHO team that visited the two hospitals Wednesday. Five remaining doctors and five nurses along with around 80 patients remain in Ahli, he said.All of the hospital buildings are damaged except two, where patients are now kept: the orthopedics ward and a church on the grounds, he said, where “patients were crying out in pain, but were also crying out for us to give them water.”Israel’s military says 137 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. Israel says it has killed some 7,000 militants, without providing evidence. It blames the high number civilian deaths in Gaza on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields when it fights in residential areas.—Jeffery reported from Cairo, Barry from Milan, Italy.

        "title_text": "It’s Not Easy to Be Old, Gay, or Homeless in the Philippines. These Drag Queens Are All Three",
        "body_text": "The path to the Home for the Golden Gays is dark and littered with stray cats. To get in and out at night, its elderly residents need to use flashlights to assist their deteriorating eyesight as they squeeze through the labyrinth of alleys, trying not to get their manicured feet wet from puddles or to trip on uneven concrete. The actual edifice—a two-bedroom, two-storey apartment, currently shared by nine people aged 60 to 93—stands out in teal from the dinginess of Manila’s ginnels. A miniature rainbow flag waves by its door frame, trimmed by a curtain of beads.While there’s barely enough space in the apartment for all its tenants to sleep comfortably, it’s still better than the other option: the streets. “Thank you Lord,” says Ramon Busa, the 74-year-old president of the organization and matron of the house, “we ended up here, and we found this place.” (Busa requested that the Golden Gays be referred to with feminine pronouns in English.)Envisioned originally to be a care home for aging members of the outcasted gay community, the Home for the Golden Gays was started by the late columnist and Pasay City councilor Justo C. Justo in the 1970s. Justo used his own residence for the effort until his death in 2012, when disgruntled relatives of his kicked the affectionately-nicknamed lolas (grandmothers) out, and soon they were back on the streets. It was only in 2018 that the latest residents cobbled together enough money to rent the apartment they’re living in today.But even now, the status of the shelter is precarious. It persists only on irregular donations, mixed in with the elderly residents’ earnings from performances and side gigs as haircutters or street vendors—gigs that grow increasingly difficult to maintain due to declining physical capacity. The group’s official slogan serves as both mantra and warning: “Bawal magkasakit” (Don’t get sick).“There’s no time for a lola to take care of someone else,” Busa says. “That’s why you need to be healthy.”The sight of an elderly person begging for alms has become more common in Manila’s streets. It’s not clear how many elderly are homeless, but the number of Filipinos aged 60 and above has doubled over the last 20 years to more than 9 million, or about eight percent of the population, while almost a fifth of the country’s 100-million strong population has fallen below the poverty threshold of having a budget of about $42 per month per capita, around a million of which are persons aged 60 and up. Meanwhile, homes remain too expensive for many to buy and own, and latest data from the national statistics office shows that an estimated 4.5 million Filipinos were homeless in 2018.The LGBT sector also disproportionately struggles, long discriminated against by a predominantly Catholic society. While the Philippines has in recent years become slightly more welcoming, many older LGBT Filipinos had a hard time getting formal jobs in their youth on account of their sexuality. Now that they’ve aged, they have no state pensions, and many have been shunned by their families, too. To be old and LGBT can be particularly difficult. Official statistics on the elder LGBT community remain scant, but a survey of LGBT-identifying Filipinos aged between 50 and 74 released in June found that 40% of respondents lacked money for necessities like food and medication. According to the survey, 48% of the respondents feared losing their homes within 2022. Some were unstably housed and others said they lived on the streets or in parks. The Home for the Golden Gays offers itself as a community-based solution to these struggles. The residents, while they accept donations, are no beggars. They are happy to work, though their options are limited—some peddle cigarettes, others hairdress, and they all perform regularly as drag queens at a nearby restaurant. “We enjoy it, we feel that we’re going back to our younger days,” says 62-year-old tenant Flor Bien Jr., who goes by Divine Amparo. “When you’re on stage, you forget the illnesses, the pains that you feel.”But the residents remain keenly aware of mortality, noting the extra salve or pain relief pads needed after each show. Bien Jr. says she gets checked regularly for diseases like hypertension and diabetes, and she’s more cautious about wearing heels for fear of falling over, which she was better able to endure when she was younger. “You can never tell what’s going to happen to you,” she says.One somber reminder sits on a shelf in the house den: a small marble urn containing the ashes of a former resident of the home, Federico Ramasamy, who once shared a cramped room with other Golden Gays before they found the house in Pasay. Ramasamy, known better as Lola Rica, died in 2020 from complications after a hit-and-run, Busa says. Since she died during the height of the pandemic, when bodies were ordered to be cremated, Ramasamy did not get a proper funeral. The remaining lolas plan to scatter Lola Rica’s ashes into the sea—while donning black gowns, they insist—when they have the money, they say less assuredly.They know their own deaths inch closer every day, much closer for some of them, but Busa says they’re neither afraid nor melancholic. “The show must go on,” she says. “It will come, but you don’t wait for it to come.”Still, the Golden Gays’ drag performances are work as much as they are expressions of pride and joy. To keep their shelter and cover utilities, the lolas must raise at least 17,000 pesos (about $300) a month, which can be quite the demand.Earlier this year, a younger Filipino drag queen who goes by the name Precious Paula Nicole made it a “passion project” to coordinate proceeds from the Golden Gays’ pageants into a fund to find the senescent community a more sustainable living situation. Precious met them at one of their gigs and says she teared up upon learning of their plight, reminded of her own grandparents and saddened by the fact that society leaves so many elderly individuals behind. “They need a permanent home,” Precious tells TIME, “so that they don’t have to wait for Pride Month or Christmas, the only times when people would reach out to them and help.” But it’s an uphill task: Precious admits that they’re nowhere near their savings goal and that recent donations have had to make up for missed monthly dues.For now, the lolas need to keep working and depending on charity. In the meantime, Bien, who plans to stay with her fellow Golden Gays until she dies, says she likes to imagine what a proper care home would feel like, even if it doesn’t come in her lifetime.“We don’t really need a big home—what’s most important is a place that accommodates all of us,” Bien tells TIME. “This is what acceptance and love is.”",

        "title_text": "Who Decided January 1st Is the New Year?",
        "body_text": "Could you imagine watching the ball in Times Square drop around March?You might have been, had much of the Western world not adopted the modern calendar that begins each year on Jan. 1.The oldest recorded new year festivities date back to 2000 B.C. in ancient Mesopotamia, where Iraq is now. Called akitu, the festival, which could last for up to 12 days, started on the day of the first new moon after the spring equinox—the day when sunlight and darkness are equally long. It usually fell around March. For Babylonians at the time, the festival signaled the crowning of a new king or a reaffirmation of loyalty to the current king.Various calendars tend to tie their own new year celebrations with other significant events—whether religious, astronomical, or agricultural. Mesopotamia’s akitu also coincided with the harvest of barley. In China, which has a 3,500-year (and counting) history of celebrating the new year, the year begins on the second new moon following the winter solstice, which usually falls around late January or February, marking the start of spring. Read More: 5 Things to Know About Lunar New Year and How It’s Celebrated Across AsiaIn ancient Egypt, a new year began when Sirius—the brightest star in the night sky—appeared around mid-July, coinciding with the cyclical flooding of the Nile, which helped irrigate nearby farmland. And because the ancient Egyptians’ calendar had twelve 30-day months, they would celebrate the new year for five days before counting the beginning of the first month to maintain the lunar cycle.Pre-Islamic Arabia didn’t have a standard calendar, but by 638 A.D., the second Islamic caliph, Umar I, sought to resolve confusion over different calendars’ recognitions of significant dates in the religion by establishing the lunar Islamic calendar. In that, a new year begins on 1 Muharram (the first day of the first sacred month), when the first crescent moon appears. It was chosen to start counting at July 16, 622 in the Julian calendar to honor the day Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina to set up the first Islamic state. The start of year 1446 in the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri calendar and which is only 354 or 355 days per year, will be on July 7 or 8, 2024, depending on where in the world you are.Ancient Rome was quite a different story. The earliest known calendars there, established by the first king, Romulus, began in Martius (which would become March), coinciding with when new consuls—the highest elected office—took power. But it only ran for 304 days or 10 months, with an unassigned winter period between years. Around the 7th century B.C., ancient Rome’s second king, Numa Popilius, added 50 days to the calendar year to cover the winter period and divided the year unevenly into 12 months, adding Ianuarius (to honor the god of beginnings, Janus) and Februarius (to reference the purification festival called Februa during that month). By 153 B.C., the inauguration of new consuls was moved to Ianuarius, although this was not fixed.This may sound like a familiar calendar already, but there remained a key difference from what much of the world uses today: the Roman calendar year was ostensibly lunar-based, but with a moon phase cycle lasting 29.5 days, the calendar sometimes fell out of sync to the point that an additional month had to be introduced—Mercedonius—every so often to get back on track.When Julius Caesar became dictator of Rome in 46 B.C., he sought advice from astronomers and mathematician Sosigenes to make up a new calendar based on the sun. By 45 B.C., the new Julian calendar was created, and the civil year in Rome now officially began on January 1. The Julian calendar also introduced an extra day every four years—what we now call leap years, like 2024 will be—but overestimated the length of a solar year by some 11 minutes.The Julian calendar would be co-opted throughout many parts of Europe as the Roman Empire expanded, but its new year’s day didn’t stick everywhere. For much of medieval Christian Europe, Christmas Day, Dec. 25, marked the start of a new year, while in some other countries it fell on March 25, as part of the Feast of the Annunciation.But the Julian calendar’s 11-minute error would have a cumulative effect over years: by the mid-15th century, it was off the solar cycle by an additional 10 days. The Catholic Church noticed this mismatch, and in the 1570s Pope Gregory XIII introduced a new calendar that would address the discrepancy by making it so that no centurial year (i.e. 1700) gets the extra leap day unless the year is divisible by 400 (i.e. 2000). The Gregorian calendar also formalized Jan. 1 as the start of every new year.Much of the world came to accept the Gregorian calendar, noted for its accuracy. Still, Great Britain and its American colonies did not quickly adopt it, refusing to recognize the authority of the Pope. For nearly 200 years, Britons used both calendars and dated documents twice. By 1752, however, the two calendars were off by 11 days, and Parliament in London relented to abandoning the Julian calendar. Even in many countries where the Islamic calendar or lunar calendar are culturally more prominent, the Gregorian calendar has now been widely adopted as the international-standard civil calendar for governments and businesses.So when the ball drops in Times Square on Sunday night, most of the world’s 8.1 billion people—thanks to the long history spanning the first civilization in Mesopotamia to Julius Caesar and Pope Gregory XIII—will be wishing their neighbors a happy New Year!",

        "title_text": "What Topped Asia’s Legal Agenda in 2023—From Same-Sex Marriage to the Death Penalty",
        "body_text": "While Asia may have a reputation—fostered by some of its own leaders—of having distinct “values” and political concerns from the West, this year showed that some issues are universal, especially as it pertains to human rights and criminal justice reform.The continent, which has long been characterized by conservative social values and a stringent, sometimes authoritarian approach to law enforcement, saw several countries’ leaders, legislatures, or courts turn their focus to things like drug legalization, death penalty reform, and LGBT inclusivity.And analysts say that, because neighboring nations influence each other, it’s likely these sorts of topics will continue to get attention in the coming years—and the decisions made on them will ripple across the region.Not all countries moved in the same direction. Some liberalized their laws, while others doubled down on their existing stances.Here are some of the most significant legal developments in Asia in 2023:Last year, Thailand became the first country in Asia to fully legalize cannabis. But since then, new Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, who took charge in August, has announced that he would roll back the changes to landmark legalization, limiting the use of cannabis to medical purposes.Read More: Thailand Had Notoriously Harsh Drug Laws. Now Weed Is Legal—and That’s Making Things ComplicatedSpecific legislation has yet to be introduced according to the proposed curbs, though Srettha said in September that changes would happen within six months.  In February Hong Kong banned CBD, the cannabis-derived compound that has gained immense popularity in the wellness sector for its therapeutic effects. With the classification of CBD as a “dangerous drug,” the ban effectively shut down what had been one of Asia’s most promising CBD markets.On Dec. 6, Japan’s parliament passed a bill to legalize medical products that contain cannabis, such as Epidiolex, a drug used to treat severe epilepsy. But at the same time, authorities also tightened cannabis rules, plugging a previous loophole that criminalized the possession and cultivation of cannabis but not its use. (Those found using cannabis may now be jailed up to seven years.)Still, another prominent loophole in Japan’s cannabis laws remains: not all synthetic cannabinoids that mimic the effects of cannabis are illegal, and even with bans implemented over the past year on specific cannabinoids, authorities are stuck playing regulatory catch-up as synthetic substances are developed and hit the market.The past year has been marked by historic criminal sentencing reforms in Malaysia, which has observed a moratorium on executions since 2018. In April, Malaysia’s parliament passed a bill that repealed the mandatory death penalty for offenses that had previously carried it—now allowing judges to exercise discretion on handing out capital punishment for crimes such as drug trafficking and murder. The bill also scrapped the death penalty entirely for another set of crimes, such as attempted murder and kidnapping, and abolished natural-life prison sentences that keep convicts imprisoned until their deaths. Read More: As Singapore Hangs More Drug Offenders, Some Worry Cases Aren’t Always Clear-CutThe legislative changes in Malaysia have sparked a wave of resentencing applications by death row inmates. In November, the first batch of applicants—including seven on death row—had their sentences commuted to 30 year prison terms.According to Indonesia’s revised criminal code, which was ratified by President Joko Widodo in January and is expected to take effect in 2026, death sentences would come with an automatic probation period of 10 years, after which they may be commuted to life imprisonment if the inmates demonstrate good behavior. The new criminal code also removed the death sentence from a set of criminal offenses that previously carried it, including piracy resulting in death and gang robbery resulting in death.While South Korea is said to have abolished the death penalty de facto—its last execution was carried out in 1997—recent legal developments have kept capital punishment embedded in the country’s laws. Authorities said in June that they would scrap legal clauses that exempted death row inmates from execution after 30 years. And in July, new amendments to South Korea’s criminal code passed by its parliament also expanded the death penalty to be applicable to infanticide. Announced after a spate of high-profile baby killings in the country, those found guilty of committing infanticide could face life imprisonment or the death penalty, instead of the previous maximum sentence of 10 years.In June, Nepal’s top court ordered that, in the absence of legislation and in recognition of equal rights, the marriages of same-sex and non-traditional heterosexual couples should be registered—making the South Asian country the second in Asia after Taiwan to legalize same-sex marriages. Some lower courts have pushed back on the ruling, but in November, the first same-sex marriage in the country was registered, in the Dordi rural municipality in eastern Nepal. Read More: Courts in Japan Support Same-Sex Marriage, But Lawmakers Are Reluctant to Legalize It. Here’s WhyAfter Srettha took over the Thai premiership, his Cabinet approved a bill on marriage equality, and in December, the nation’s parliament approved four different draft bills, which will still need another review, another vote, and approval by the military-appointed Senate and the Thai king, before any becomes law. Despite being a country known for its visible LGBT and gender-nonconforming community, Thailand has struggled to pass marriage equality legislation. Previous attempts have languished, but if the latest push does succeed, Thailand will become the first country in Southeast Asia to grant legal recognition to same-sex marriages.Many Indians were eagerly waiting for the country’s Supreme Court to recognize same-sex unions five years after it nixed a colonial-era ban on gay sex, but their hopes ended in disappointment this year when the body declined to do so in October, arguing instead that such a decision should be left to lawmakers. The court also ruled against granting adoption rights to unmarried same-sex couples. The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has staunchly opposed a marriage equality policy, saying that approving such unions would cause “complete havoc” in the country. Hong Kong’s top court ruled in February that it was unconstitutional to require transgender people to have full gender-affirming surgery before they could change their legal gender markers, such as on their IDs. But despite the historic ruling, the semi-autonomous Chinese region still has no gender recognition law, and authorities have yet to change the markers on many transgender citizens’ identity cards.Read More: He Won a Landmark Trans Rights Case in Hong Kong—But His Work Is Just BeginningOn May 19, Pakistan’s Federal Shariat Court struck down provisions in its Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, which was passed by Parliament in 2018 to protect the rights of transgender people in the South Asian nation. The new amendments effectively disable transgender people from changing their gender markers on official documents to match their gender identities. Protests broke out after the ruling, with human rights group Amnesty International calling the move “a blow to the rights of the already beleaguered group of transgender and gender-diverse people.” Advocates plan to appeal the ruling.A 2003 Japanese law that required sterilization surgery for those who wish to change their gender markers was struck down in October by the country’s Supreme Court. But the justices did not agree on whether it was constitutional or not to require a person’s genitals to “resemble those of the desired gender,” so they sent that provision to a lower court to review.Nonetheless, the ruling came at a time of heightened awareness of the need for greater attention to the LGBT community, with the government passing a law promoting LGBT “understanding” in July. Transgender people also scored another legal victory in Japan the same month, after the country’s top court outlawed restricting their use of gendered bathrooms.",

        "body_text": "PRAGUE — Three foreign nationals were among the 25 people wounded when a student opened fire at a university in the Czech capital, Prague, shooting dead 14 people before killing himself, authorities said Friday. It was the worst mass shooting in Czech history.Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said police in Prague worked overnight and all the 14 who died in Thursday's attack have been identified. The Institute of Music Sciences confirmed that its head, Lenka Hlávková, was among the dead.The Czech Foreign Ministry confirmed that three of those wounded were foreigners — two from United Arab Emirates and one from the Netherlands.The bloodshed took place at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University, where the 24-year-old shooter was a student, Prague Police Chief Martin Vondrasek said. Petr Matejcek, the director of the police regional headquarters in Prague said the gunman killed himself on the balcony of the university building when police officers approached him. The gunman's name has not been released.Authorities warned that the death toll could rise.Early Friday, with the scene of the shooting still sealed off by the police, people could be seen lighting candles to mourn the victims at an impromptu vigil by the university headquarters.Police said Friday they have boosted security at schools and other “soft targets” — usually public facilities that are difficult to secure — in a preventive measure. University rectors also said they would work with police experts on more preventive measures to increase security around campus.Police have released no details about the dead and wounded or a possible motive for the shooting at the building. Rakusan said Thursday that investigators didn't suspect a link to any extremist ideology or groups. Officials said they believed the gunman acted alone.Vondrasek, the police chief, said they believe the man killed his father earlier on Thursday in his hometown of Hostoun, just west of Prague, and that he had also been planning to kill himself. He also said the gunman was suspected of killing a man and his 2-month-old daughter on Dec. 15, in Prague.Police said the shooter had legally owned several guns and that he was heavily armed during the attack.Leaders from many countries, including the United States, and the U.N Secretary-General conveyed their condolences. The Czech government declared Saturday a national day of mourning to honor the victims.Previously, the nation’s worst mass shooting was in 2015, when a gunman opened fire in the southeastern town of Uhersky Brod, killing eight before fatally shooting himself.The building where the shooting took place is located near the Vltava River in Jan Palach Square, a busy tourist area in Prague’s Old Town. It is just a few minutes’ walk from the picturesque Old Town Square, a major tourist attraction where a popular Christmas market attracts thousands of visitors.",

        "title_text": "13 Ways the World Got Better in 2023",
        "body_text": "As in most years, much of the media focus in 2023 was on the myriad crises people all over the world faced, from horrific wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to devastating natural disasters (many climate-change-related) in Turkey, Southeast Africa, Hawaii, Canada, and more. At the end of this long year, though, it's worth taking a step back and considering some of the ways things improved. Here are some examples, gathered together by TIME's climate and health journalists:Since the pandemic began, COVID-19 has been a leading cause of death both in the U.S. and around the world. That began to change this year, thanks in part to widespread access to updated vaccines and treatments that prevent the worst of disease. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of early December, around 65,000 people in the U.S. had died from COVID-19 in 2023 —less than half the number who died from the virus in 2022. The trends have been similarly dramatic—in a good way—at the global level, World Health Organization data show.—Jamie DucharmeIn the U.S., projected life expectancy is already creeping back upward as fewer lives are claimed by the virus, a trend that will likely continue as lifespan estimates reflect the progress made in 2023.—J.D.The proliferance of electric vehicles has reached a scale where they are finally making a noticeable dent in global oil use. In 2023, EVs are expected to have cut oil demand by about 1.8 million barrels per day, according to BloombergNEF. That represents about 2% of global supply. Analysts expect this to accelerate, with EVs projected to displace as much as 12.4 million barrels of oil per day by 2035. In fact, despite some reporting that car dealers are offering EV discounts, suggesting that consumer demand in the U.S. is waning (citing reasons such as cost and lack of charging infrastructure), EV sales have actually been strong this year. While there may be regional differences, national sales have been growing year-over-year. And according to market research firm Rho Motion, global sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids increased 20% as of this November compared to a year ago; North America and China represent the bulk of this growth. This makes EV uptake the only indicator of climate progress monitored by the World Resources Institute that is considered on track for helping meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C global warming limit.—Kyla MandelWith each passing year, more becomes possible in the world of medicine—and 2023 was no exception, with doctors and researchers achieving sci-fi-like results in the operating room. To name only a few surgical advances we saw this year: a pig kidney and heart worked in human bodies for two months and six weeks, respectively, suggesting that animal organs may someday be viable options for transplantation; surgeons performed the world’s first whole-eye transplant, in a big step toward treating vision loss; and researchers demonstrated that it’s possible to partially reverse paralysis after accidents or strokes. All of these innovations remain works in progress, but they’re hopeful signs of what’s to come. —J.D.There is no shortage of good ideas for new zero-carbon tech. The tricky part, though, is scaling those innovations up to a point where they can make a dent in emissions. Fortunately, a lot of great ideas made that kind of progress this year, thanks in part to incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act passed last summer. For instance, in May, Form Energy started construction on a West Virginia factory to produce cheap, long-lasting iron-air batteries to store renewable energy on the grid. In September, Antora Energy, which makes carbon-based thermal batteries that could help decarbonize industrial facilities like paper mills and glass factories, turned on its first commercial-scale battery, and followed it up with a plan to build its first factory to produce them in San Jose, Calif. These ideas and others like them have a long way to go before they actually reduce emissions at scale. But the fact that such novel concepts are moving past small-scale trials and investor presentations and out into the real world is heartening. Addressing climate change doesn’t just mean using the technologies we’ve got. We can use new ones, too, if we can scale them up in time.—Alejandro de la GarzaJeremy Ney wrote recently for TIME:In October 2023, the FBI released their annual crime report, which highlighted a welcome and surprising trend that violent crime is declining in America. Not only has violent crime fallen 23% from 2002 to 2022, but also in the past year alone murders fell 6% and violent crime declined 2% overall.New York City, which has been lambasted by politicians for having high crime rates, has actually seen declines in most categories of violent crime. Murders in NYC are down 26.7% from this time last year, burglaries are down 22%, shootings are down 8%, and hate crimes are down 9%; although anti-semitic incidents have spiked in the last month. Overall, violent crime has decreased 49% since its peak in 1991 from a rate of 758 violent crime offenses per every 100,000 people to 380 per 100,000.—Jeremy NeyTwo thirds of the world’s oceans lie outside of national jurisdictions, a virtually lawless commons where marine areas rich in biodiversity are at risk of unfettered exploitation, from overfishing to ship pollution and seabed mining. The High Seas, as these international waters are known, play a crucial role in maintaining planetary health by absorbing both heat and CO2 emissions while nurturing the world’s ocean economy.That free-for all is coming to an end. On June 19 the United Nations adopted a new treaty laying the groundwork for marine protection in previously unregulated waters. Officially known as the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction treaty, the High Seas treaty provides, for the first time, a legal basis for establishing large-scale marine protected areas—a crucial tool to meet a global goal to protect 30% of the earth’s land and sea by 2030.—Aryn BakerUnited Nations climate negotiations are an odd beast. For decades, laggard countries used the annual talks to proffer skepticism of climate science. And, during all that time, the final agreements of the meetings studiously neglected to name the biggest cause of global warming: fossil fuels. At COP28 in Dubai this year, countries finally fessed up to the scale—and primary cause—of the problem. For the first time, a COP agreement called for a transition away from fossil fuels alongside a dramatic scale up of renewable energy. Many critics point out that the deal is non-binding, limiting its influence. But the non-binding nature of the deal, known as the UAE Consensus, is borne of a recognition of the scale and complexity of the problem. How can emerging economies commit without knowing whether they will receive the massive sums of capital necessary to transition?  Now, the serious work begins to implement, including raising the necessary money.—Justin WorlandTalk of energy transition has finally turned into concrete action as developers build out clean-energy infrastructure at an unprecedented scale. Global investment in clean energy topped $1.7 trillion this year, compared with just $1 trillion invested in fossil fuels, according to data from the International Energy Agency. That investment includes both longstanding technologies—think of wind turbines and solar farms—as well as more nascent technologies like batteries and heat pumps. Challenges remain, of course. In many parts of the world, permitting issues have delayed project timelines as developers wait for government approval. Labor shortages and snarled supply chains have also slowed timelines globally. But these challenges are actually a reflection of the fact that investment is happening and projects are finally moving forward—even if too slowly.—J.W.The movement to increase public access to scientific research and data made huge strides in 2023. Major publishers and institutions including Springer Nature and MIT continued to operate fledgling programs dedicated to open access, including providing funding to researchers and supporting journals committed to sharing their data. Wiley, another academic publisher, surveyed more than 600 researchers, and found that in 2023, 75% had published open access papers in the past three years, compared to just 44% of respondents in 2021. Transformative agreements, which are a popular funding strategy enabling journals to move gradually toward open access, accounted for more than 272,000 scientific articles published in 2023, up from 233,000 in 2022 and just 167,000 in 2021. These and other statistics are heartening reminders of the values that can and should shape the scholarly community, like collaboration, progress, and education. Though some experts fear that the shift toward open access could have some bumps, such as bringing more attention to non-peer-reviewed preprint sites with potential misinformation, there are no real detractors of the movement's overall goal. It’s great to see the world’s scientists agree on something.—Haley Weiss It made big news in May 2020 when 16 young Montanans, ages 5 to 22, sued the state in a landmark case titled Held vs. Montana, arguing that legislators were failing to obey a state constitutional provision guaranteeing all residents “the right to a clean and healthy environment.” Montana produces more than 30% of U.S. coal and more than 40% of the state’s energy production comes from coal-fired plants—compared to 18% for the rest of the nation—with all of the greenhouse-gas-driven drought, heatwaves, and wildfires that implies. On Aug. 12 this year, Judge Kathy Seeley ordered the state to literally clean up its act.The Held case might have been the year’ most celebrated climate lawsuit, but it was not remotely the only one. All over the world, individuals, advocacy groups, indigenous peoples, and more are increasingly taking to the courts to enforce existing environmental regulations, laws, and treaty provisions. Columbia University’s Climate Change Litigation Database currently lists 1,688 pending environmental lawsuits in the U.S. In 2023, 214 such cases were filed—a nearly four-fold increase of the 67-per-year average from 1986-2022. Climate change must be solved by a lot of smart people: scientists, treaty negotiators, legislators, advocacy groups.—and, in a happy and hopeful development, lawyers, judges, and juries are increasingly joining the fight.—Jeffrey KlugerFor the first time in the U.S., patients can take advantage of the latest gene editing technology CRISPR to functionally cure their disease. The Food and Drug Administration approved exa-cel for people with sickle cell anemia, who make sickled blood cells that don’t carry enough oxygen-loaded hemoglobin. CRISPR edits their blood-making cells so they make more healthy cells than sickled ones. The entire procedure is invasive and intense, and takes about nine months and involves a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, but has reduced the number of painful crises among patients who tested it, and kept them out of the hospital for at least a year. While not a total cure, CRISPR-based therapies could be a transformative treatment, not just for sickle cell patients, but for those with other genetic conditions as well.—Alice ParkJoy is a vital human emotion—but as researchers noted in 2020, \"surprisingly little\" study has investigated exactly what it means and how to experience more of it. In 2023, that started to change. Researchers from more than a dozen institutions, including Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley, teamed up to determine whether performing micro-acts of joy changes how people feel in the short- and long-term, and whether there are differences based on factors like age, race, and location. Inaugural data from the BIG JOY Project—the world's largest citizen science project on joy, with nearly 70,000 participants spanning more than 200 countries—were released in November. Among the findings: Daily micro-acts of joy, like making a gratitude list or practicing positive reframing, helped participants experience a 25% increase in emotional well-being, 34% boost in levels of coping perception, and 12% jump in self-reported sleep quality over the course of a week. People can still sign up to participate in the project, and published research further quantifying the benefits of joy is expected in 2024.—Angela Haupt ",

        "title_text": "5 Shock Events to the World That Are Already in Sight",
        "body_text": "In 2023, we have witnessed plenty of shock events: consider, for instance, Hamas’ attack on Israel and Israel’s subsequent siege on Gaza, Chinese \"spy balloons,” the assassination of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, and even UFOs that may be extraterrestrial. Shock events are risks—or threats to stability—that, while they are in the realm of possibility, are very hard to predict. That said, attempting to determine what they are can serve as a useful tool to help decision makers, from policymakers and investors to businesses and nonprofits, prepare for unexpected challenges in the future.Based on a four-year research project with graduate students in international relations at New York University where I teach and experts at consultancy Wikistrat where I’m a lead analyst, we leveraged open source information and our collective work expertise to crowdsource geopolitical, political, economic, and social shock events that may rock our post-pandemic world by 2025.Here are five to consider:2022’s COP27 reminded us that we will fail to meet our 1.5C target, and in truth, not much changed at COP28 in December 2023. Indeed, the Loss and Damage Fund—an emergency program announced in 2022 to help countries prepare for the impacts of climate change—was “historic.” But the commitments are not where we need them to be: only 700 million was pledged this year when an estimated 400 billion a year is needed.Leaders at COP28 called for a just \"transition away\" from fossil fuels by 2050—yet governments continue to spend billions to support that industry. Countries also might need 300 billion a year in adaptation financing, according to the UN, which wasn’t given sufficient attention at COP28. All signs point to the fact that we should expect more fossil fuel usage, climate events, and community displacement in the years to come.Read More: Was COP28 a Success or Flop? Depends Who You AskWithout sufficient climate action, the potentiality of a private actor, particularly a billionaire, to take matters into their own hands by “hacking” the planet is rising. One such strategy is solar geoengineering. U.S.-based startup Make Sunsets, for instance, has already started this in a minor way, with reflective clouds released into the stratosphere that reflect the sun's rays and cool the planet. But it would be worth it, then, for us to keep an eye out for a sole private investor to back this type of initiative or even another cooling approach in a major way. George Soros, for one, has already endorsed a similar cause in the Arctic.Solar geoengineering is controversial (the U.S. and EU are already considering regulation of the practice) and could even lead to conflict, if, for instance, one country attempts it and it has a spillover effect on its neighbor—or even the world. Yet, billionaire-backed climate tech like solar geoengineering seems plausible by 2025 and inevitable this decade.Another high probability risk if governments fail to stop fossil fuels is more climate action—but not just in terms of protests. It might become more violent in nature. Of course, we can expect more youth-driven activist protests against governments and oil firms, as well as more pushback against ESG investing and more activist investors in boardrooms pressuring companies to go green. We will also see more lawsuits against local governments (similarly to what a group of young people did this August when they sued Montana for their climate impacts) and oil companies for climate damages (like California and the UN attempted to do in May).The shock event here, however, would be if people so devastated by a massive climate event form a violent uprising against climate-inactive governments or oil companies. Yes, eco-terrorism has some historical precedent with groups like the Earth Liberation Front. But it’s plausible that a new form of militant activism emerges as citizen frustration grows. This could also create a dangerous cycle of violence as climate deniers and eco-terrorists clash, while legitimate activists may be scapegoated and targeted by governments.The dollar is a key marker (and weapon) of American hegemonic power. While it’s unlikely to be replaced as the global reserve currency, its role in international trade is definitely under attack. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there were recurrent discussions of a new currency proposed by intergovernmental organization BRICS, and calls by China to use its own currency in more trade. Yet it had limited traction.This sentiment has come back with a vengeance in our post-pandemic world. At South Africa's 2023 BRICS Summit, discussions of a new currency resurfaced as this China-driven, anti-Western initiative found enthusiastic new members like Argentina, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia. More oil trade has already moved away from the dollar, with China and India leveraging their own currencies. But now non-oil trade is also looking beyond the dollar: for instance, the UAE and Sri Lanka are exploring rupee transactions with India.Regional currencies may still be perceived as a pipe dream, but the momentum for them is also building in Latin America, South East Asia, and Africa; and there’s always a chance that cryptocurrencies make a comeback or central bank digital currencies finally cement their status in international finance. As a result, the shock would come when more trade is done in other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar; 2025 is likely too soon but this trend will evolve this decade, eroding U.S. financial power by 2030.We’ve all heard the shocking predictions from tech leaders like Sam Altman and intellectuals like Yuval Noah Harari: AI, if not regulated, has the potential to destroy humanity. But while it’s certainly not possible by 2025, there is legitimate concern about AI tools triggering war.It could be a deep fake video that accelerates tensions between two longtime rival countries, or cyberattacks that ensure a presidential run, or simply the use of AI weapons that many researchers and industry leaders have warned could lead to World War 3. This is why technologists like Inflection’s Mustafa Suleyman are calling for regulation now—before negative actors find a way to leverage it for their cause.Read More: How We Can Have AI Progress Without Sacrificing Safety or DemocracyWe also may see conflict within societies. The reality is that much of the population will lose our jobs to automation, generative AI, and whatever AI trend is next. It’s estimated that 85 million jobs will be lost to AI worldwide by 2025, according to a 2020 World Economic Forum report. It's fair to assume that governments will fail to prepare all of us to immediately fit into this new AI-driven economy—at least not by 2025. As a result, many may lose our occupational identity.We must look for more unexpected outbursts of anti-tech activity. It could be anti-tech protests that are destabilizing for our societies, but it could also be direct attacks on tech firms or tech leaders themselves, who are so public about the change that is upon us but simply can’t save everyone from unemployment.In November 2023, most prediction markets still envisioned an incumbent President Joe Biden win, but they are currently favoring former President Donald Trump’s return—though so far it’s too close to tell, according to some polls. A lot can happen between now and November 2024 and polls can be wrong. But at this stage, it is impossible to ignore the fact that President Biden’s poll numbers are weakening, Trump has raised millions for his campaign, his indictments appear to have made him more popular among his voters and his party. In fact, a November 2023 New York Times/Siena College poll reveals he has the edge in five battleground states.Short of him being convicted before the election, being disqualified from more ballots, or another Republican (or independent) candidate rising to the occasion, it is hard to see his momentum slowing down. The concern about Biden’s health (and polls reaffirming this) further support a Republican win. Trump’s return seems the most plausible of these shocks by 2025—and the most dangerous. It will mean a resurgence in domestic and global instability. For instance, in the U.S., hate crimes have the potential to surge as far right extremists become emboldened by Trump, who recently said he would expel pro-Hamas immigrants at a rally.Globally, major risks like climate change would be put on the back burner such that climate disasters would become more frequent, creating more climate refugees and conflict. He would stop aid to Ukraine, which would dramatically change the outcome of the Ukrainian-Russian war; he would battle it out with China over Taiwan; he would reject Gazan refugees in support of Israel, and so on. Another Trump presidency would further destabilize our world order.It’s clear that our post-pandemic world is ultimately being shaped by wars, climate challenges, and new technologies—and yet it may increasingly be driven by such unexpected shock events, too. Why is this the case? One possible, overarching reason is that we have moved on from a post-Cold War era that is no longer exclusively shaped by enduring global leadership, democratic ideals, globalization, and liberal values. Instead, it is shaped by the lack of consensus about our world order more than anything else.",

        "title_text": "U.N. Approves Resolution on More Gaza Aid, But Stops Short of Calling for a Ceasefire",
        "body_text": "UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council adopted a watered-down resolution Friday calling for immediately speeding aid deliveries to hungry and desperate civilians in Gaza but without the original plea for an “urgent suspension of hostilities” between Israel and Hamas.The long-delayed vote in the 15-member council was 13-0 with the United States and Russia abstaining. The U.S. abstention avoided a third American veto of a Gaza resolution following Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel. Russia wanted the stronger language restored; the U.S. did not.Still, \"It was the Christmas miracle we were all hoping for,” said United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, who sponsored the resolution. She said it would send a signal to the people in Gaza that the Security Council was working to alleviate their suffering.The resolution culminated a week and a half of high-level diplomacy by the United States, the UAE on behalf of Arab nations and others. The vote, initially scheduled for Monday, was pushed back each day until Friday.A relieved U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council, “This was tough, but we got there.”She said the vote bolsters efforts “to alleviate this humanitarian crisis, to get life-saving assistance into Gaza and to get hostages out of Gaza, to push for the protection of innocent civilians and humanitarian workers, and to work towards a lasting peace.”“It is hard to overstate how urgent this is,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “This resolution speaks to the severity of this crisis, and it calls on us all to do more.”The vote came immediately after the United States vetoed a Russian amendment that would have restored the call to immediately suspend hostilities. That vote was 10 countries in favor, the U.S. against and four abstentions,Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called the resolution “entirely toothless” and accused the United States of “shameful, cynical and irresponsible conduct” and resorting to tactics “of gross pressure, blackmail and twisting arms.\"He said the resolution “would essentially be giving the Israeli armed forces complete freedom of movement for the clearing of the Gaza Strip.” Russia would have vetoed it, he said, if it hadn't been supported by a number of Arab countries.Thus the resolution was stripped of its key provision with teeth — the call for “the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\"Instead, it calls “for urgent steps to immediately allow safe, unhindered and expanded humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.” The steps are not defined, but diplomats said it was the council’s first reference to stopping fighting.Ambassador Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. envoy, said it took the Security Council 75 days “to finally utter the words ‘cessation of hostilities,'\" stressing that the Palestinians and Arab nations supported the Russian amendment.“This resolution is a step in the right direction” because of its important humanitarian provisions, Mansour said. “It must be implemented and must be accompanied by massive pressure for an immediate cease-fire.”Hamas called the resolution “an insufficient step\" that \"doesn't meet the requirements of the catastrophic state caused by the terrorist military machine in Gaza.” The militant group accused the United States of defying the international community and blocking the council from demanding a halt to the war in the statement on its website.Israel’s U.N. deputy ambassador Brett Jonathan Miller criticized the Security Council for not condemning Hamas for its Oct. 7 attacks in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage.The resolution more generally “deplores all attacks against civilians and civilian objects as well as all violence and hostilities against civilians, and all acts of terrorism.” It also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.On a key sticking point concerning aid deliveries, the resolution eliminated a previous request for the U.N. “to exclusively monitor all humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza provided through land, sea and air routes” by outside parties to confirm their humanitarian nature.It substituted a request to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to quickly appoint a coordinator to monitor relief deliveries to Gaza that are not from the parties to the conflict — Israel and Hamas — to verify that they are humanitarian goods. It asks the coordinator to establish a “mechanism” to speed aid deliveries and demands that Israel and Hamas cooperate with the coordinator.Miller said “humanitarian aid is pouring into Gaza every single day” and Israel is willing to increase the number of aid trucks entering the territory and the only roadblock is “the U.N.’s ability to accept them.” He stressed that “any enhancement of U.N. aid monitoring cannot be done at the expense of Israel’s security inspections.”Guterres countered at a press conference that it's a mistake to measure the effectiveness of the humanitarian operation in Gaza by the number of trucks.“The real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza,” the U.N. chief said. He said the four elements of an effective aid operation don't exist — security, staff that can work in safety, logistical capacity especially trucks, and the resumption of commercial activity in the territory.The secretary-general reiterated his longstanding call for a humanitarian cease-fire. He expressed hope that Friday's resolution may help this happen but said \"much more is needed immediately” to end the ongoing “nightmare” for the people in Gaza.Guterres has said Gaza faces “a humanitarian catastrophe” and warned that a total collapse of the humanitarian support system would lead to “a complete breakdown of public order and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt.”According to a report released Thursday by 23 U.N. and humanitarian agencies, Gaza’s entire 2.2 million population is in a food crisis or worse and 576,600 are at the “catastrophic” starvation level. With supplies to Gaza cut off except for a small trickle, the U.N. World Food Program has said 90% of the population is regularly going without food for a full day — and Guterres said Friday that “four out of five of the hungriest people anywhere in the world are in Gaza.”More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war started, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, and its Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Thousands more Palestinians lie buried under the rubble of Gaza, the U.N. estimates.The resolution reiterates the Security Council’s “unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders,.\" That stresses “the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.”Security Council resolutions are important because they are legally binding, but in practice many parties choose to ignore the council’s requests for action. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are a significant barometer of world opinion.In its first unified action following the Hamas attacks, the Security Council adopted a resolution on Nov. 15 with the U.S. abstaining calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” in the fighting, unhindered aid deliveries to civilians and the unconditional release of all hostages.The U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution on Oct. 18 to condemn all violence against civilians in the Israel-Hamas war and to urge humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. On Dec. 8, the U.S. vetoed a second council resolution backed by almost all other council members and dozens of other nations, demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza. The 193-member General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a similar resolution on Dec. 12 by a vote of 153-10, with 23 abstentions.",

        "title_text": "Czech Republic Holds National Day of Mourning For Victims of Prague University Shooting",
        "body_text": "Two days after a gunman killed 14 people and injured at least 25 others at the Faculty of Arts building belonging to Prague’s Charles University, the Czech Republic held a day of mourning to remember the victims. Flags were flying at half mast on Saturday and bells tolled at noon. The public observed a minute’s silence for those who lost their lives. At 11 a.m., a requiem was held in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, chaired by Prague Archbishop Jan Graubner and attended by President Petr Pavel, who called for the day of mourning. Video footage streamed by Czech TV showed the church packed with mourners amid hymns and speeches. At 3 p.m., another ecumenical prayer and moment of silence is scheduled to take place at Kostel sv. Martina ve zdi (Church of St Martin in the Wall). “My thoughts are still with families of the victims, injured and those who had to fight for their lives at the Faculty of Arts,” Pavel said via social media on Friday. “No one can imagine the fear and mental strain they went through yesterday. From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank [you] for the sincere condolences and words of support, which come from all around the world.” A police investigation has been launched, looking into the crime that shocked the relatively safe country with few mass shootings. On Thursday, the gunman killed 14 people and injured 25 before killing himself. Police have not yet released the names of the victims. The university confirmed that two of its staff members were killed and the Lidove Noviny daily said its employee, a first-year student, had also been killed, the Associated Press reported. Three foreign nationals—two from the United Arab Emirates and one from the Netherlands—were among the injured, the Czech Foreign Ministry said. Police said the gunman acted alone and was not connected to international terrorism. The gunman is believed to have killed his father earlier in the day. Police are also investigating the gunman’s connection to the killing of a man and child in a forest on Dec. 15, with police saying on X that the weapon used in that shooting was a match to a gun found in the house where the university shooter lived. Gun deaths are far less common in the Czech Republic than in the U.S., data shows. According to police, the gunman legally owned multiple weapons. The country has looser gun laws than other European nations, but gun owners must still pass a test, background check and health clearance, and can have weapons taken away over mental health concerns. The government added this last check after a 2015 mass shooting, the nation’s previous deadliest, where a shooter killed eight people before himself. As police and politicians continue to investigate what led to the shooting, the community was providing spaces to mourn and mentally process the tragedy. Police started an emergency number to provide support to the students’ relatives at +420 974 823 158, the Czech Foreign Ministry said. Charles University was providing psychological support and counseling to those affected, and taking donations through its foundation to support the families of victims, students and teachers.The Prague Archbishop also set up a hotline for spiritual counsel for people impacted. The Czech Foreign Ministry has set up an electronic book of condolences to allow people from around the world to send messages to kondolence@mzv.gov.cz.

        "title_text": "U.N. Criticized Over ‘Watered-Down’ Resolution That Fails to Call For a Gaza Ceasefire",
        "body_text": "Global organizations have criticized the U.N. Security Council resolution that called for more humanitarian aid without demanding an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war to facilitate its delivery.The U.S. vetoed a Russian amendment that would have included ceasefire language, Al Jazeera U.N. reporter Rami Ayari reported. Instead, after delays and debates for days, the final version resolved that the parties must allow safe, unhindered and expanded humanitarian access to Gaza and “create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.” The measure passed Friday at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City with 13 votes in favor. The U.S. and Russia abstained from voting. Earlier this month, the U.S. cast the sole veto against a resolution calling for a ceasefire.The U.N. and humanitarian groups serving more than two million people who are stuck in Gaza and facing a \"hunger crisis\" said the new resolution would do little to end suffering and death without an immediate and sustained ceasefire. In less than three months, 20,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, \"the vast majority women and children,\" per the U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres.“This resolution has been watered down to the point that its impact on the lives of civilians in Gaza will be nearly meaningless,” Avril Benoît, executive director of MSF (Doctors without Borders) USA said in a statement. “More and more member states recognise that a ceasefire is indispensable to addressing the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, yet the Council has yet again failed to call for one.”During a press briefing after the vote, Guterres told reporters that the only way to stop the “ongoing nightmare” in Gaza was a humanitarian ceasefire. Israel controls aid into the territory and Guterres said the current aid operation lacks the necessary security to succeed, saying “the real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza.”TIME reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for a response. The International Rescue Committee called the failure to call for a ceasefire “unjustifiable,\" while other groups specifically criticized the U.S.Oxfam’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Sally Abi-Khalil, said in a statement that “the U.S.' removal of calls to suspend hostilities shows just how out of touch its policies are with the urgency and terror that Palestinians are experiencing. Its actions in the Security Council demonstrate the U.S.' increased isolation from the global consensus.\" Amnesty International accused the U.S. of using the threat of its veto power to stall and weaken the resolution, calling the move “disgraceful.” During the meeting, Russia’s ambassador to the U.N. Vasily Nebenzya called out, what he views as, “shameful, cynical and irresponsible conduct by the United States.” He accused the U.S. of resorting to “gross pressure, blackmail, and twisting arms” to get a “rubber stamp” on its version of the resolution.   The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said she wouldn’t respond to Russia’s “rant,” pointing out that Russia has created similar conditions in its war in Ukraine. In explaining her vote, Thomas-Greenfield noted the resolution “does not support any steps that would leave Hamas in power which, in turn, would undermine the prospects for a two-state solution where Gaza and the West Bank are reunited under a single governance structure, under a revamped and revitalized Palestinian Authority.”Thomas-Greenfield instead pushed for more humanitarian “pauses.” A temporary truce the last week of November allowed aid and the exchange of dozens of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Negotiations on another truce have reportedly stalled, as Israel has vowed to not stop its war until Hamas is eliminated, while Hamas refuses to release hostages unless the war ends. Thomas-Greenfield said she was “appalled” that “once again” the council did not include language to condemn Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, where militants killed 1,200 people and reportedly sexually assaulted women. She said the U.S. supports Israel’s right to protect itself, but noted both sides must follow international law and respect civilian facilities such as hospitals and places of worship. There is growing concern that has not been done in Gaza. In the past two months, Israeli troops infiltrated a major hospital and the Catholic Church reported Israeli snipers shot dead two Christian women sheltering inside a church, an act Pope Francis condemned.Benoît criticized that “the way Israel is prosecuting this war, with U.S. support, is causing massive death and suffering among Palestinian civilians and is inconsistent with international norms and laws.”  In an emailed response to questions about the way in which the IDF is carrying out its assault against Hamas in Gaza, an IDF spokesperson tells TIME: \"Hamas has a documented practice of operating from nearby, underneath and within densely populated areas. The IDF’s strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions and after an assessment that the expected incidental damage to civilians and civilian property is not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage from the attack.\"Commenting on the aforementioned report of two Christian women being shot inside a Catholic church, the spokesperson says: \"The IDF has finished conducting an initial review of the incident. The review found that on December 17th, in the early afternoon, Hamas terrorists launched a Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) at IDF troops from the vicinity of the church. The troops then identified three people in the vicinity, operating as spotters for Hamas by guiding their attacks in the direction of the IDF troops.\"\"In response, our troops fired towards the spotters and hits were identified. While this incident occurred in the area where the two women were reportedly killed, the reports received do not match the conclusion of our initial review which found that the IDF troops were targeting spotters in enemy lookouts. We are continuing our examination of the incident.\"The spokesperson added that \"the IDF takes claims of strikes on sensitive sites very seriously, especially churches that are the holy sites for the Christian faith\" and that operations are targeted \"against the Hamas terrorist organization and not against civilians.\"Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said accusations Israel was breaking international law were “hogwash” because the military wasn’t intentionally targeting civilians, saying civilian deaths were “collateral damage” or “unintended casualties.” The IDF previously told TIME it takes “all operationally feasible measures” to protect civilians.Guterres said Friday there is no effective protection for civilians in Gaza. People who cannot leave the territory without Israel’s permission have fled to a designated “safe” area the size of an airport in a coastal desert. Many had earlier left Gaza’s north, following Israeli evacuation orders, to so-called safe cities in the south, only to have Israel bomb those cities.Now, more than half a million people are starving, Guterres said. There is not enough clean water. Hospitals are barely functioning.“Humanitarian veterans who have served in war zones and disasters around the world—people who have seen everything,” he said, “tell me they have seen nothing like what they see today in Gaza.”",

        "body_text": "Beside the nativity manger, where baby Jesus, draped in a Palestinian keffiyeh, lay amid rocks, Rev. Dr. Munther Isaac stood at the pulpit of the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem to deliver his Christmas sermon.“If Jesus were to be born today, he would be born under the rubble in Gaza,” Isaac said in his address during the “Christ in the Rubble: A Liturgy of Lament” service on Dec. 23 in the West Bank. Isaac, a Palestinian Christian theologian, told the congregation that the Christmas message “is not about Santa, trees, gifts, lights, etc. My goodness, how we twisted the meaning of Christmas. How we have commercialized Christmas.” Instead, he said, the Christmas message is that Jesus, who miraculously survived a massacre, was “born among the occupied and marginalized. He is in solidarity with us in our pain and brokenness.”    The reverend called out the Western world, which he views as complicit in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza that has displaced two million people and killed 20,000—actions he called “a genocide.”“Let it be clear: Silence is complicity, and empty calls for peace without a ceasefire and end to occupation, and the shallow words of empathy without direct action—are all under the banner of complicity,” he said. The true Christmas message, he argued, is that “this genocide must stop now.”   Read more: Is What’s Happening in Gaza a Genocide? Experts Weigh InGenocide experts have offered different opinions on whether Israel’s actions meet the United Nations’ definition of genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Complaints have been filed in the International Criminal Court alleging genocide conducted by both Hamas and Israel, and its chief investigator is gathering information about potential crimes.The Israeli mission to the U.N. in Geneva has called genocide accusations \"deplorable and deeply concerning\" and pointed out the current war was brought upon Israel by Hamas, who killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, in Israel on Oct. 7, Reuters reported. Hamas also kidnapped around 240 people—130 of whom remain in captivity, with at least 20 of them believed to be dead.Read. more: Amid the Israel-Hamas War, Iran Marches Towards Nuclear BreakoutIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to criticism of Palestinian civilian deaths by French President Emmanuel Macron via social media, saying on Nov. 10 that “the responsibility for any harm to civilians lies with Hamas” and said Israel “does everything in its power to avoid harming civilians and urges them to leave the battle areas.” Citing a frequent response that Israel is acting in self-defense in Gaza, Isaac in his message asked “how is the killing of 9,000 children self-defense?”“We are angry. We are broken. This should have been a time of joy; instead, we are mourning. We are fearful,” he began his message. “Gaza as we know it no longer exists,” he continued, adding that Palestinians in the West Bank were now also asking “could this be our fate in Bethlehem?” Isaac acknowledged with gratitude a global group of Christian leaders, led by a South African delegation, who came to mourn in solidarity at the service, which was live-streamed by the American Red Letter Christians group, but called out the broader Western world for its silence. He also called out the “theology of Empire” from the Western church that he said “becomes a powerful tool to mask oppression under the cloak of divine sanction. It divides people into “us” and “them.\"Read more: The World’s Job During the War on HamasIsaac claimed the war has proven that the “Western world does not see us as equal,” adding that the “hypocrisy and racism of the Western world is transparent and appalling.” He said he never wanted to get a lecture on human rights from the West again, because he said it appeared as though those laws didn’t apply to non-white Palestinians.To those who are not appalled by what is happening, Isaac said “there is something wrong with your humanity” adding that “Gaza today has become the moral compass of the world.”In reference to the name and theme of his Christmas sermon, Isaac said that the “Christ in the rubble” manger is about “resilience,” exemplified in Jesus’ meekness, weakness and vulnerability. “Resilience because this very same child, rose up from the midst of pain, destruction, darkness and death to challenge Empires, to speak truth to power and deliver an everlasting victory over death and darkness.”",

        "body_text": "LONDON — British Home Secretary James Cleverly was under fire Sunday for joking about date rape just hours after announcing plans to crack down on what he had dubbed a “perverse” offense.Cleverly, who oversees national security and law enforcement in England and Wales, faced a call to step down after he reportedly joked at an event at the prime minister’s home about drugging his wife.He told women guests at a Dec. 18 reception that the secret to a long marriage was having a spouse who “is always mildly sedated so she can never realize there are better men out there,” the Sunday Mirror newspaper reported.Cleverly said \"a little bit of Rohypnol\" — the so-called date rape drug — \"in her drink every night” was “not really illegal if it’s only a little bit.”The drug, colloquially known as a roofie when it is crushed and put into someone's beverage without their knowledge, makes the subject drowsy and can lead to unconsciousness and memory loss.Cleverly apologized through a spokesperson for what he called an “ironic joke” after he had announced the Conservative government planned to update legislation to make clear that such drink spiking is illegal. He described the practice as a “perverse” crime.The comments were made during a drinks reception at 10 Downing Street where political journalists mingled with political aides, ministers and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Conversations at such events are typically off the record, but the Sunday Mirror said it decided to report the news because of Cleverly’s position and the subject matter.“In what was always understood as a private conversation, James, the home secretary tackling spiking, made what was clearly meant to be an ironic joke – for which he apologizes,” his spokesperson said.Jemima Olchawski, chief executive of the women’s rights group the Fawcett Society said the remarks were “sickening,” and she called on Cleverly to resign.“How can we trust him to seriously address violence against women and girls?” Olchawski said in a statement. “It’s sickening that the senior minister in charge of keeping women safe thinks that something as terrifying as drugging women is a laughing matter.”Cleverly, 54, who met his wife in college and has two children, previously described tackling violence against women and girls as a personal priority.Senior members of the opposition Labour Party condemned the “appalling” comments.“It is truly unbelievable that the home secretary made such appalling jokes on the very same day the government announced new policy on spiking,” Yvette Cooper, a Labour member of Parliament, said. \"Victims will understandably be questioning if they can trust him to take this vile crime seriously.”The government has pledged to clarify that drink spiking is a crime while stopping short of making it a specific offense.Police in England and Wales receive an average of 561 reports of spiking a month, mainly by women who report incidents at bars and nightclubs, according to a Home Office report.",

It’s perhaps the election year.Globally, more voters than ever in history will head to the polls as at least 64 countries (plus the European Union)—representing a combined population of about 49% of the people in the world—are meant to hold national elections, the results of which, for many, will prove consequential for years to come.Read More: A Make-or-Break Year for Democracy WorldwideIn Taiwan, for example, who becomes the next president will fundamentally shape Beijing’s approach to the self-governed island it has repeatedly threatened with invasion.Read More: Taiwan’s Presidential Frontrunner Faces Balancing Act With ChinaOf course, simply holding an election does not mean the process will be free or fair.

        "title_text": "In Christmas Day Blessing, Pope Francis Denounces the Weapons Industry and Appeals For World Peace",
        "body_text": "ROME (AP) — Pope Francis on Monday blasted the weapons industry and its “instruments of death” that fuel wars as he made a Christmas Day appeal for peace in the world and in particular between Israel and the Palestinians.Speaking from the loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica to the throngs of people below, Francis said he grieved the “abominable attack” of Hamas against southern Israel on Oct. 7 and called for the release of hostages. And he begged for an end to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the “appalling harvest of innocent civilians” as he called for humanitarian aid to reach those in need.Francis devoted his Christmas Day blessing to a call for peace in the world, noting that the biblical story of the birth of Christ in Bethlehem sent a message of peace. But he said that Bethlehem “is a place of sorrow and silence” this year.Francis’ annual “Urbi et Orbi” (\"To the City and the World\") speech typically offers a lament of all the misery facing the world, and this year’s edition was no different. From Armenia and Azerbaijan to Syria and Yemen, Ukraine to South Sudan and Congo and the Korean peninsula, Francis appealed for humanitarian initiatives, dialogue and security to prevail over violence and death.He called for governments and people of goodwill in the Americas in particular to address the “troubling phenomenon” of migration and its “unscrupulous traffickers” who take advantage of innocents just looking for a better life.He took particular aim at the weapons industry, which he said was fueling the conflicts around the globe with scarcely anyone paying attention.“It should be talked about and written about, so as to bring to light the interests and the profits that move the puppet strings of war,” he said. “And how can we even speak of peace, when arms production, sales and trade are on the rise?”Francis has frequently blasted the weapons industry as “merchants of death” and has said that wars today, in Ukraine, in particular, are being used to try out new weapons or use up old stockpiles.He called for peace between Israel and Palestinians, and for the conflict to be resolved “through sincere and persevering dialogue between the parties, sustained by strong political will and the support of the international community.”Vatican officials said about 70,000 people filled St. Peter's Square for Francis' noonday speech and blessing. They included many people flying Palestinian flags, as well as some Ukrainian ones.Francis' address from the loggia marked his main appearance for Christmas Day, though he is expected to deliver a blessing on Tuesday, the feast of St. Stephen, which is also a holiday in Italy. Rounding out the holiday, he is to celebrate a New Year's Eve vigil in the basilica and Mass the following day.Despite his recent bout of bronchitis, the 87-year-old Francis appeared to hold up well Monday and during Christmas Eve Mass the previous night, though he occasionally coughed and seemed out of breath.",

        "title_text": "Ukraine Says It Shot Down Russian Fighter Jets and Drones on Christmas Eve",
        "body_text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s air force on Monday reported that it shot down two Russian fighter jets during the night along with two cruise missiles and 28 Shahed-type drones.The report said the attacks were aimed at southern and central regions of Ukraine, but that no casualties were immediately known. It said that 31 drones were launched in all, but details of what the three that weren't intercepted may have struck weren't given.A summary from the Ukrainian presidential office said that one civilian was killed and at least four wounded in Russian attacks over the previous 24 hours. The death occurred in the town of Chornobaivka in the Kherson region, which is partly under Russian control and experiences daily fighting.Ukraine observed Christmas on Monday, the first time the country has officially marked the holiday on Dec. 25 rather than the Jan. 7 date followed by some Orthodox countries, including Russia.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed legislation in July to move the public holiday’s date.Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, but the faith is divided between two churches, one of which had long affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church.The Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which didn't recognize the authority of the Russian church and had been regarded as schismatic, was granted full recognition in 2018 by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Orthodoxy’s top authority.The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which was a branch of the Russian church, announced in 2022 after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war that it was breaking ties with Moscow and considered itself autonomous. However, its parishes continue to follow the same liturgical calendar as the Russian church and will observe Christmas on Jan. 7.",

        "title_text": "Israeli Forces Bombard Central Gaza in Apparent Move Toward Expanding Ground Offensive",
        "body_text": "(RAFAH, Gaza Strip) — Israeli forces bombarded Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza on Tuesday, residents said, in apparent preparation to expand their ground offensive into a third section of the besieged territory.The opening of a potential new battle zone points to the long and destructive road still ahead as Israel vows to crush Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. For weeks, Israeli forces have been engaged in heavy urban fighting in northern Gaza and in the southern city of Khan Younis, driving Palestinians into further smaller corners of territory in search of refuge.Despite international pressure for a cease-fire and U.S. calls for a reduction in civilian casualties, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned that the fight “isn’t close to finished.”Israel’s offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than 20,600 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, whose count doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants.Read More: Inside the Israel-Hamas Information WarMeanwhile, there were new signs of the Israel-Hamas war enflaming tensions around the region. An Israeli airstrike in Syria killed an Iranian general, bringing vows of revenge from Iran. U.S. warplanes hit Iranian-backed militias in Iraq that had carried out a drone strike that wounded American soldiers there.Residents of central Gaza on Tuesday described a night of shelling and airstrikes shaking the Nuseirat, Maghazi and Bureij camps. The camps are built-up towns, housing Palestinians driven from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war and their descendants — and now are also crowded with people who fled the north.“The bombing was very intense,” Radwan Abu Sheitta, a Palestinian teacher said by phone from his home in Bureij. “It seems they are approaching,” he said of Israeli troops.The Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military arm, said that its fighters struck an Israeli tank east of Bureij. Its report couldn't be independently confirmed, but it suggested Israeli forces were moving toward the camp.REGIONAL SPILLOVERThroughout the war, a constellation of Iranian-backed militia groups around the region have stepped up attacks in support of Hamas. So far, all sides have appeared to calibrate the violence to stay short of sparking an all-out conflict, but the fear is that an unexpected escalation could spiral out of control.Iranian-backed militias in Iraq carried out a drone strike on a U.S. base in Irbil in northern Iraq on Monday, wounding three American servicemembers, one of them critically, according to U.S. officials. It was the latest in more than 100 attacks that militias have carried out on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.In response, American warplanes before dawn Tuesday hit three locations in Iraq connected to one of the main militias, Kataib Hezbollah.The Israeli strike on Monday hit a neighborhood of the Syrian capital, Damascus, killing Gen. Seyed Razi Mousavi, an adviser of the Iranian paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. The strike hit as he was entering a farm reportedly used as an office of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the district of Sayeda Zeinab on Damascus’ outskirts, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Almost daily, Hezbollah and Israel exchange volleys of missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the Israeli-Lebanese border. Around 150 people have been killed on the Lebanese side, mostly fighters from Hezbollah and other groups but also 17 civilians. At least seven soldiers and four civilians have been killed on the Israeli side.In the Red Sea, attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen against commercial ships have disrupted trade and prompted a U.S.-led multinational naval operation to protect shipping routes.GAZA FIGHTINGIsraeli troops have been engaged in nearly two months of ground combat with Hamas and other militants in northern Gaza and weeks of urban fighting in Khan Younis. The battles and bombardment have leveled large swaths of both areas, and strikes have continued across the territory.Still, Hamas fighters have shown a tough resilience. The Israeli military announced the deaths of two more soldiers Tuesday, bringing the total killed in the ground offensive to 158. Militants late Monday launched a barrage of rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens in the southern city of Ashkelon. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.Israel has vowed to continue fighting to eliminate Hamas’ military and governing capabilities in Gaza, after the militants carried out their shock attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. Israel says it also aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.Israel blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll in Gaza, citing the militants’ use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.A strike Tuesday hit the home of the Habash family in Mawasi, a rural area on Gaza's southern coastline that Israel has declared a safe zone for people to take shelter. One woman was killed, and at least eight other people were wounded, according to a cameraman working for The Associated Press at the nearby hospital. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military on the strike.The expanding fighting has pushed Gaza's population into a shrinking area, particularly the central city of Deir al-Balah and Rafah, in the far south on the Egyptian border. Both have come under continuous bombardment. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population is starving under Israel’s siege, which allows in only a trickle of food, water, fuel, medicine and other supplies into the territory.The U.N. Security Council last week called for immediately speeding up aid deliveries to Gaza. But so far there has been little concrete sign of a change in entry of aid, which the U.N. has said it struggles to distribute because many areas are cut off by fighting.Meanwhile, negotiations have seemed to make little headway toward a pause in fighting to allow more hostage releases in exchange for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Egypt put forward an ambitious peace proposal aiming not only to end the war but also to lay out a plan for the day after. It calls for a phased hostage release and the formation of a Palestinian government of experts to administer the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank.But it has gotten a cool public reception from Israel and Hamas. It falls short of Israel’s declared goal of crushing Hamas and appears to be at odds with Israel’s insistence on maintaining military control over Gaza for an extended period after the war. It is also unclear if Hamas would agree to relinquish power after controlling Gaza for the past 16 years.___Wafaa Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Samy Magdy from Cairo.",

        "title_text": "Biden Orders Strikes on Iranian-Aligned Group After U.S. Troops Injured in Drone Attack in Iraq",
        "body_text": "(WASHINGTON) — President Joe Biden ordered the United States military to carry out retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian-backed militia groups after three U.S. service members were injured in a drone attack in northern Iraq.National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said one of the U.S. troops suffered critical injuries in the attack that occurred earlier Monday. The Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups, under an umbrella of Iranian-backed militants, claimed credit for the attack that utilized a one-way attack drone.Iraqi officials said U.S. strikes targeting militia sites early Tuesday killed one militant and injured 18. They came at a time of heightened fears of a regional spillover of the Israel-Hamas war.Iran announced Monday that an Israeli strike on the outskirts of the Syrian capital of Damascus killed one of its top generals, Razi Mousavi, who had been a close companion of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the former head of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Soleimani was slain in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020.Iranian officials vowed revenge for the killing of Mousavi but did not immediately launch a retaliatory strike. The militia attack Monday in northern Iraq was launched prior to the strike in Syria that killed Mousavi.Biden, who was spending Christmas at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, was alerted about the attack by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan shortly after it occurred Monday and ordered the Pentagon and his top national security aides to prepare response options to the attack on an air base used by American troops in Irbil.Sullivan consulted with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Biden's deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, was with the president at Camp David and convened top aides to review options, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity.Within hours, Biden convened his national security team for a call in which Austin and Gen. CQ Brown, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed Biden on the response options. Biden opted to target three locations used by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups, the official said.The U.S. strikes were carried out at about 4:45 a.m. Tuesday in Iraq, less than 13 hours after the U.S. personnel were attacked. According to U.S. Central Command, the retaliatory strikes on the three sites \"destroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants.”\"The President places no higher priority than the protection of American personnel serving in harm’s way,\" Watson said. “The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue.”The latest attack on U.S. troops follows months of escalating threats and actions against American forces in the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the devastating war in Gaza.The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. Iranian-backed militias have carried out more than 100 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two months ago.In November, U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and command and control node, following a short-range ballistic missile attack on U.S. forces at Al-Assad Air Base in western Iraq. Iranian-backed militias also carried out a drone attack at the same air base in October, causing minor injuries.The U.S. has also blamed Iran, which has funded and trained Hamas, for attacks by Yemen’s Houthi militants against commercial and military vessels through a critical shipping choke point in the Red Sea.The Biden administration has sought to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from spiraling into a wider regional conflict that either opens up new fronts of Israeli fighting or draws the U.S. in directly. The administration’s measured response — where not every attempt on American troops has been met with a counterattack — has drawn criticism from Republicans.The U.S. has thousands of troops in Iraq training Iraqi forces and combating remnants of the Islamic State group, and hundreds in Syria, mostly on the counter-IS mission. They have come under dozens of attacks, though as yet none fatal, since the war began on Oct. 7, with the U.S. attributing responsibility to Iran-backed groups.\"While we do not seek to escalate conflict in the region, we are committed and fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities,\" Austin said in a statement.The clashes put the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in a delicate position. He came to power in 2022 with the backing of a coalition of Iranian-backed parties, some of which are associated with the same militias launching the attacks on U.S. bases.A group of Iranian-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces were key in the fight against Islamic State militants after the extremist group overran much of Iraq in 2014. The PMF is officially under the command of the Iraqi army, but in practice the militias operate independently.In a statement Tuesday, Sudani condemned both the militia attack in Irbil and the U.S. response.Attacks on “foreign diplomatic mission headquarters and sites hosting military advisors from friendly nations … infringe upon Iraq’s sovereignty and are deemed unacceptable under any circumstances,” the statement said.However, it added that that the retaliatory strikes by the U.S. on “Iraqi military sites” — referring to the militia — “constitute a clear hostile act.” Sudani said some of those injured in the strikes were civilians.___Abdul-Zahra reported from Baghdad.",

        "body_text": "ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Gunmen attacked remote villages over the weekend in north-central Nigeria’s Plateau state, killing at least 140 people, officials and survivors said Tuesday, the latest case this year of such mass killings blamed on the farmer-herder crisis in the West African nation.The assailants targeted 17 communities in “senseless and unprovoked” attacks on Saturday and Sunday, burning down most houses in the area, Plateau Gov. Caleb Mutfwang said in a broadcast on the local Channels Television.“As I am talking to you, in Mangu local governorate alone, we buried 15 people. As of this morning, in Bokkos, we are counting not less than 100 corpses. I am yet to take stock of (the deaths in) Barkin Ladi,” Mutfwan said. “It has been a very terrifying Christmas for us here in Plateau.\"Amnesty International's Nigeria office told The Associated Press that it has so far confirmed 140 deaths in the Christian-dominated Bokkos and Barkin-Ladi areas of Plateau, based on data compiled by its workers on the ground and from local officials. There were fears of a higher death toll as some people remained unaccounted for.Some of the locals said that it took more than 12 hours before security agencies responded to their call for help, a claim the AP couldn't independently verify, but which echoes past concerns about slow interventions in Nigeria‘s deadly security crisis, which has killed hundreds this year, including in Plateau.“I called security but they never came. The ambush started 6 in the evening but security reached our place by 7 in the morning,” said Sunday Dawum, a youth leader in Bokkos. At least 27 people were killed in his village, Mbom Mbaru, including his brother, he said.No group took responsibility for the attacks though blame fell on herders from the Fulani tribe, who have been accused of carrying out such mass killings across the northwest and central regions where the decadeslong conflict over access to land and water has further worsened the sectarian division between Christians and Muslims in Africa’s most populous nation.The Nigerian army said it has begun “clearance operations” in search of suspects, with the help of other security agencies, although arrests are rare in such attacks.Abdullsalam Abubakar, who commands the army’s special intervention operation in Plateau and neighboring states, said his forces “will not rest” until they find those responsible.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who was elected this year after promising to tackle security challenges his predecessor had failed to address, instructed security agencies to “scour every stretch of the zone and apprehend the culprits,” according to a statement from his office. He also ordered the “immediate mobilization of relief resources” for the survivors and prompt medical treatment for the wounded, it added.Amnesty's Nigeria director Isa Sanusi said Tinubu’s government and others have failed to take “tangible action” to protect lives and ensure justice for victims in the conflict-hit northern region.“Sometimes they claim to make arrests but there is no proof they have done so,” he said. “The brazen failure of the authorities to protect the people of Nigeria is gradually becoming the norm.\"",

        "title_text": "Israeli Teen Sentenced to 30 Days in Prison For Refusing to Serve in IDF Shares Release Update",
        "body_text": "The 18-year-old Israeli activist who was sentenced to 30 days in military prison after he refused to enlist in the Israeli army has been temporarily released from prison. Tal Mitnick announced that he was “back for a bit” on his X account Thursday morning. His prison sentence may be extended past the initial 30 days if he again refuses to enlist.  “I believe that slaughter cannot solve slaughter,” said Mitnick in December, before he walked into Tel HaShomer military base, according to a video posted on the X account of Mesarvot, an organization that connects young Israelis who do not want to serve in the state military. “The criminal attack on Gaza won’t solve the atrocious slaughter that Hamas executed. Violence won’t solve violence. And that is why I refuse.”A group of people gathered in solidarity with Mitnick before he entered the military base where he was arrested on Dec. 26. Mitnick shared a letter from prison on Jan. 3, sharing bits of his life in prison. Mitnik said that he feels “moved” by the support he has received. “Despite the commanders and military system controlling when I eat, stand, sit, and sleep, what keeps me strong is knowing that what they cannot control is what I think,” the letter says. The decision comes during a period of despair for Gazans who remain subject to bombs and attacks by Israeli forces nearly 12 weeks after the war began. More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to numbers provided by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry on Friday. A United Nations report has also warned that more than half a million people in Gaza are starving, with the risk of famine increasing every day.  Israel is currently facing a suit brought against them by South Africa at the International Court of Justice for allegations of genocide. The International Criminal Court is also investigating Israeli officials for possible war crimes. “On the seventh of october, Israeli society experienced a trauma the likes of which was not known in the history of the country…After the terrorist attack, a revenge campaign began not only against Hamas, but against all Palestinian people,” said Mitnick in a statement shared by The Intercept journalist Prem Thakker. “I refuse to believe that more violence will bring security, I refuse to take part in a war of revenge. Refuseniks, or people who refuse to serve in the military, are not very common in Israel, though there has been press around previous dissent years prior to the ongoing war. Earlier this year, hundreds of Israeli teens refused to join the army as a way to protest the government's plan for a judicial overhaul that they said would turn the country into an undemocratic nation. “We must stop the judicial overhaul and we must stop taking part in a military that serves settlements and the occupation,” said Mitnick in September, prior to the war.  Israeli law requires all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 that are Jewish, Druze or Circassian to serve in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), with some exceptions for Israeli Arabs, religious women, married couples or for people who are medically or mentally unfit, according to the IDF’s website. Some ultra-orthodox Jews, like Haredi Jews, are also exempt from serving in the military Men are expected to serve at least 32 months, while women must serve a minimum of 24. Israel has one of the largest military in the world, The International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Military balance 2023 said there were nearly 170,000 active military personnel, though the army has many hundreds of thousands more in reserve that they can bring in for supplemental aid. ",

        "body_text": "The U.S. on Thursday imposed sanctions on a group of money exchange services from Yemen and Turkey alleged to help provide funding to Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who have been launching attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the southern Red Sea.Included in the sanctions are the head of a financial intermediary in Sana'a, Yemen, along with three exchange houses in Yemen and Turkey. U.S. Treasury alleges that the people and firms helped transfer millions of dollars to the Houthis at the direction of sanctioned Iranian financial facilitator Sa'id al-Jamal.The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans.Thursday's action is the latest round of financial penalties meant to punish the Houthis.Earlier this month, the U.S. announced sanctions against 13 people and firms alleged to be providing tens of millions of dollars from the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities to the Houthis in Yemen.Brian E. Nelson, Treasury's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said Thursday's action \"underscores our resolve to restrict the illicit flow of funds to the Houthis, who continue to conduct dangerous attacks on international shipping and risk further destabilizing the region.\"Nelsons said the U.S. and its allies \"will continue to target the key facilitation networks that enable the destabilizing activities of the Houthis and their backers in Iran.\"The Houthis have sporadically targeted ships in the region in the past, but the attacks have increased since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, spiking after an Oct. 17 explosion at a hospital in Gaza killed and injured many. Houthi leaders have insisted Israel is their target.In December, the White House also announced that it was encouraging its allies to join the Combined Maritime Forces, a 39-member partnership that exists to counter malign action by non-state actors in international waters, as it looks to push back against the Houthis.The attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi rebels have scared off some of the world's top shipping companies and oil giants, effectively rerouting global trade away from a crucial artery for consumer goods and energy supplies that is expected to trigger delays and rising prices.",

        "title_text": "Israeli Strikes Across Gaza Kill Dozens of Palestinians, Even in Largely Emptied North",
        "body_text": "Israeli forces bombarded cities, towns and refugee camps across Gaza on Thursday, killing dozens of people in a widening air and ground offensive against Hamas that has forced thousands more to flee from homes and shelters in recent days.The war has already killed over 20,000 Palestinians and driven around 85% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Much of northern Gaza has been leveled, and it has been largely depopulated and isolated from the rest of the territory for weeks. Many fear a similar fate awaits the south as Israel expands its offensive to most of the tiny enclave.Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas — which is still putting up stiff resistance, even in the north — and bring back more than 100 hostages still held by the militants after their Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.Israeli officials have brushed off international calls for a cease-fire, saying it would amount to a victory for Hamas.The United States — while providing crucial support for the offensive — has urged Israel to take greater measures to spare civilians and allow in more aid. But humanitarian workers say the amount of food, fuel and medical supplies entering is still far below what is needed, and 1 in 4 Palestinians in Gaza is starving, according to U.N. officials.An Israeli airstrike on a home in the northern town of Beit Lahiyeh — one of the first targets of the ground invasion that began in October — buried at least 21 people, including women and children, according to a family member.Bassel Kheir al-Din, a journalist with a local TV station, said the strike flattened his family house and severely damaged three neighboring homes. He said 12 members of his family — including three children ages 2, 7 and 8 — were buried and presumed dead, and that nine neighbors were missing.In central Gaza, Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the built-up Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps, leveling buildings, residents said. Israel said this week it would expand its ground offensive into central Gaza. The Israeli military typically launches waves of airstrikes and shelling before troops and tanks move in.A hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received the bodies of 25 people killed overnight, including five children and seven women, hospital records showed Thursday. Nonstop explosions could be heard throughout the night in the town where hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter, with many spending cold nights sleeping on sidewalks.“It was another night of killing and massacres,” said Saeed Moustafa, a resident of the Nuseirat camp. He said people were still crying out from the rubble of a house hit Wednesday by an airstrike.“We are unable to get them out. We hear their screams, but we don’t have equipment,\" he said.Farther south, in Khan Younis, the Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike near its Al-Amal Hospital killed at least 10 people and wounded another 12. Much of the city’s population has left, but many are sheltering near Al-Amal and another hospital, hoping they will be spared from the bombardment.A strike Thursday evening destroyed a residential building in the town of Rafah, at the southernmost end of Gaza, killing at least 18 people, doctors at the nearby Al-Kuwaiti Hospital said.Rami Abu Mosab, who lives in the Bureij refugee camp, said thousands of people have fled their homes in recent days because of the intense bombardment. He plans to remain there because nowhere in Gaza is safe.“Here is death and there is death,” he said, “To die in your home is better.”Bureij and Nuseirat are among several camps across the region that were built to house hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. They have since grown into crowded residential neighborhoods.Some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during that conflict, an exodus the Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or catastrophe. Some 1.9 million have been displaced within Gaza since Oct. 7.As Israel has broadened its offensive, fleeing Palestinians have packed into areas along the Egyptian border and the southern Mediterranean coastline, where shelters and tent camps are overflowing. Even in those areas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets.The U.N. humanitarian office said the scale and intensity of the fighting impedes its aid deliveries. The office, known as OCHA, cited blocked roads, a scarcity of fuel and telecommunications blackouts as some of the obstacles hampering the humanitarian response.Still, it said the U.N. World Food Program provided food parcels to about a half-million people in U.N. shelters in southern and central Gaza since Saturday.The Israeli military blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas, which positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense residential areas. But the military rarely comments on individual strikes.Israel's offensive in Gaza has already been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than 21,300 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza. Another 55,600 have been wounded, it says. Those counts do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.The military says it has killed thousands of militants, without presenting evidence, and that 167 of its soldiers have been killed and hundreds wounded in the ground offensive.",

        "body_text": "The world population grew by 75 million people over the past year and on New Year's Day it will stand at more than 8 billion people, according to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Thursday.The worldwide growth rate in the past year was just under 1%. At the start of 2024, 4.3 births and two deaths are expected worldwide every second, according to the Census Bureau figures.The growth rate for the United States in the past year was 0.53%, about half the worldwide figure. The U.S. added 1.7 million people and will have a population on New Year's Day of 335.8 million people.If the current pace continues through the end of the decade, the 2020s could be the slowest-growing decade in U.S. history, yielding a growth rate of less than 4% over the 10-year-period from 2020 to 2030, said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution.The slowest-growing decade currently was in the aftermath of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when the growth rate was 7.3%.“Of course growth may tick up a bit as we leave the pandemic years. But it would still be difficult to get to 7.3%,” Frey said.At the start of 2024, the United States is expected to experience one birth every nine seconds and one death every 9.5 seconds. However, immigration will keep the population from dropping. Net international migration is expected to add one person to the U.S. population every 28.3 seconds. This combination of births, deaths and net international migration will increase the U.S. population by one person every 24.2 seconds.",

        "title_text": "Russia Launches the Biggest Aerial Barrage of the War, Ukraine Says",
        "body_text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Russia launched 122 missiles and dozens of drones against Ukrainian targets, officials said Friday, killing at least 30 civilians across the country in what an air force official called the biggest aerial barrage of the war.At least 144 people were injured and an unknown number were buried under rubble during the roughly 18-hour onslaught, Ukrainian officials said. A maternity hospital, apartment blocks and schools were among the buildings reported damaged across Ukraine.In the capital, Kyiv, broken glass and mangled metal littered city streets. Air raid and emergency service sirens wailed as plumes of smoke drifted into a bright blue sky.Kateryna Ivanivna, a 72-year-old Kyiv resident, said she threw herself to the ground when a missile struck.“There was an explosion, then flames,” she said. “I covered my head and got down in the street. Then I ran into the subway station.”Meanwhile, in Poland, authorities said that what apparently was a Russian missile entered the country’s airspace Friday morning from the direction of Ukraine and then vanished off radars.In the attack on Ukraine, the air force intercepted most of the ballistic and cruise missiles and the Shahed-type drones overnight, said Ukraine’s military chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.Western officials and analysts had recently warned that Russia limited its cruise missile strikes for months in an apparent effort to build up stockpiles for massive strikes during the winter, hoping to break the Ukrainians’ spirit.The result was “the most massive aerial attack” since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk wrote on his official Telegram channel. It topped the previous biggest assault, in November 2022 when Russia launched 96 missiles, and this year’s biggest, with 81 missiles on March 9, according to air force records.Fighting along the front line is largely bogged down by winter weather after Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive failed to make a significant breakthrough along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) line of contact.Ukrainian officials have urged the country's Western allies to provide it with more air defenses. Their appeals have come as signs of war fatigue strain efforts to keep support in place.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the attack should stir the world to further action in support of Ukraine.“These widespread attacks on Ukraine’s cities show (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will stop at nothing to achieve his aim of eradicating freedom and democracy,” Sunak said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. “We must continue to stand with Ukraine — for as long as it takes.”Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the scale of the attack should wake people up to Ukraine's continuing needs.“Today, millions of Ukrainians awoke to the loud sound of explosions,” he wrote on X. “I wish those sounds of explosions in Ukraine could be heard all around the world. In all major capitals, headquarters, and parliaments, which are currently debating further support for Ukraine.”In Kyiv, the bombardment damaged a subway station that lies across the street from a factory belonging to the Artem company, which produces components for various military-grade missiles. Officials did not say whether the factory was directly hit.Overall, the attack hit six cities, and reports of deaths and damage came in from across the country. Several dozen missiles were launched towards Kyiv, with more than 30 intercepted, said Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv military administration. Eight people were killed there, officials said.In Boyarka, near Kyiv, the debris of a shot-down drone fell on a home and started a fire. Andrii Korobka, 47, said his mother was sleeping next to the room where the wreckage landed and was taken to hospital suffering from shock.“The war goes on, and it can happen to any house, even if you think yours will never be affected,” Korobka said.Tetiana Sakhnenko lives next door and said neighbors ran with buckets of water to put out the blaze, but it spread quickly. “It’s so scary,” she said.In the eastern city of Dnipro, four maternity hospital patients were rescued from a fire, five people were killed and 20 injured, officials said.In Odesa, on the southern coast, falling drone wreckage started a fire at a multistory residential building, according to the regional head, Oleh Kiper. Two people were killed and 15, including two children, were injured, he said.The mayor of the western city of Lviv, Andrii Sadovyi, said one person was killed there, with three schools and a kindergarten damaged in a drone attack. Local emergency services said 30 people were injured.In northeastern Ukraine, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the city was subjected to at least three waves of aerial attacks that included S-300 and Kh-21 missile launches. One person was killed and at least nine injured, officials said.___Dmytro Zhyhinas contributed to this story",

        "body_text": "BEIRUT — The U.S. military said Sunday that its forces opened fire on Houthi rebels after they attacked a cargo ship in the Red Sea, killing several of them in an escalation of the maritime conflict linked to the war in Gaza.In a series of statements, the U.S. Central Command said the crew of the USS Gravely destroyer first shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired at the Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou late Saturday after the vessel reported getting hit by a missile earlier that evening as it sailed through the Southern Red Sea.Four small boats then attacked the same cargo ship with small arms fire early Sunday and rebels tried to board the vessel, the U.S. Navy said.Next, the USS Gravely and helicopters from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier responded to the Maersk Hangzhou's distress call and issued verbal warnings to the attackers, who responded by firing on the helicopters.“The U.S. Navy helicopters returned fire in self-defense,” sinking three of the four boats and killing the people on board while the fourth boat fled the area, the U.S. Central Command said. No damage to U.S. personnel or equipment was reported.There was no immediate comment from the Houthis.The events surrounding the Maersk Hangzhou represented the the 23rd illegal attack by the Houthis on international shipping since Nov. 19, the Central Command said. It was the first time the U.S. Navy said its personnel had killed Houthi fighters since the Red Sea attacks started.For over a month, Iran-backed Houthis have claimed attacks on ships in the Red Sea that they say are either linked to Israel or heading to Israeli ports. They say their attacks aim to end the Israeli air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip that was triggered by the Palestinian militant group Hamas' Oct.7 attack in southern Israel.However, the links to the ships targeted in the rebel assaults have grown more tenuous as the attacks continue.On Saturday, the top commander of U.S. naval forces in the Middle East said Houthi rebels have shown no signs of ending their “reckless” attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea even as more nations join the international maritime mission to protect vessels in the vital waterway and trade traffic begins to pick up.Earlier this month, Washington announced the establishment of a new international coalition to protect vessels traveling through the waterway. The United Kingdom, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain are also part of the new maritime security mission.Since the Pentagon announced Operation Prosperity Guardian to counter the attacks just over 10 days ago, 1,200 merchant ships have traveled through the Red Sea region, and none has been hit by drone or missile strikes, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper said in an Associated Press interview.",

        "body_text": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II announced Sunday that she plans to leave the throne to make way for her son, Crown Prince Frederik.The queen announced during her New Year's speech that she would abdicate on Jan. 14th, which is the 52nd anniversary of her own accession to the throne at age 31 following the death of her father, King Frederik IX.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen confirmed the decision in a news release that paid tribute to the 83-year-old monarch, offering a “heartfelt thank you to Her Majesty the Queen for her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom.”The 6-foot-tall (1.82-meters-tall), chain-smoking Margrethe has been one of the most popular public figures in Denmark. She often walked the streets of Copenhagen virtually unescorted and won the admiration of Danes for her warm manners and for her talents as a linguist and designer.A keen skier, she was a member of a Danish women’s air force unit as a princess, taking part in judo courses and endurance tests in the snow. Margrethe remained tough even as she grew older. In 2011, at age 70, she visited Danish troops in southern Afghanistan wearing a military jumpsuit.As monarch, she crisscrossed the country and regularly visited Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, the two semi-independent territories which are part of the Danish Realm, and was met everywhere by cheering crowds.",

        "body_text": "(TOKYO)—A passenger plane and a Japanese coast guard aircraft collided on the runway at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Tuesday and burst into flames, with five people on the smaller plane killed, officials said.All 379 people on Japan Airlines flight JAL-516 got out safely before the plane was engulfed in flames, Transport Minister Tetsuo Saito confirmed. The pilot of the coast guard plane escaped but the five crew members died, Saito said.Tuesday’s accident was the first time one of the Airbus A350, among the industry’s newest large passenger planes, was severely damaged. It entered commercial service in 2015. Airbus in a statement said it was sending specialists to help Japanese and French authorities and that the plane was delivered to Japan Airlines in late 2021.The A350 had flown from Shin Chitose airport near the city of Sapporo, the transport minister said.Coast guard spokesperson Yoshinori Yanagishima said its Bombardier Dash-8 plane, which is based at Haneda, had been due to head to Niigata to deliver relief goods to residents affected by a deadly earthquake in the region on Monday. The turboprop Dash-8 is widely used on short-haul and commuter flights.The coast guard pilot reported to his base that his aircraft exploded after colliding with the commercial plane, Vice Commander Yoshio Seguchi told reporters.Shigenori Hiraoka, head of the Transport Ministry Civil Aviation Bureau, said the collision occurred when the JAL plane landed on one of Haneda’s four runways where the coast guard aircraft was preparing to take off. Transport safety officials were analyzing communication between aviation control officials and the two aircraft and planned to interview JAL officials to determine what led to the collision.Hiraoka praised JAL for “taking appropriate procedures” to safely evacuate all passengers and crew members.Swede Anton Deibe, 17, a passenger on the Japan Airlines plane, told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that “the entire cabin was filled with smoke within a few minutes. We threw ourselves down on the floor. Then the emergency doors were opened and we threw ourselves at them.“The smoke in the cabin stung like hell. It was a hell. We have no idea where we are going so we just run out into the field. It was chaos,\" Deibe added.Another passenger told NHK television that cabin attendants were calm and told everyone to leave their baggage behind, then all lights went off and the temperature inside the cabin started rising. The passenger said she was afraid she might not get off the plane alive.The transport minister said officials were doing their utmost to prevent any delays in the delivery of relief goods and other operations for the disaster-hit region. Transport officials said the airport's three other runways had reopened.Haneda is the busier of two major airports serving the Japanese capital, with many international and transcontinental flights. It is particularly favored by business travelers due to its proximity to central parts of the city.The twin-engine, twin-aisle A350 is used by a number of long-haul international carriers. More than 570 of the aircraft are in operation, according to Airbus.JAL operates 16 of the A350-900 version aircraft, according to its website. It recently announced details of 13 of the newer A350-1000 variant it plans to bring into service, saying it will become “the airline’s new flagship for international service after nearly 20 years.” The first of those planes arrived a few weeks ago, slated for the Haneda-New York JFK route.The International Air Transport Association trade group said on the X social media platform that its thoughts were with those aboard the two aircraft, saying that “the last two days have been difficult for Japan.\"___Yamaguchi reported from Kyoto, Japan.

        "body_text": "BEIRUT — An explosion in Beirut on Tuesday killed Saleh Arouri, a top official with the Palestinian militant group Hamas and three others, officials with Hamas and the Lebanese group Hezbollah said.Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the blast killed four people and was carried out by an Israeli drone. Israeli officials declined to comment.If Israel is behind the attack it could mark a major escalation in the Middle East conflict. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to retaliate against any Israeli targeting of Palestinian officials in Lebanon.Hamas official Bassem Naim confirmed to The Associated Press that Arouri was killed in the blast. A Hezbollah official speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations also said Arouri was killed.Read More: Inside the Israel-Hamas Information WarArouri, one of the founders of Hamas' military wing, had headed the group's presence in the West Bank. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him even before the Hamas-Israel war began on Oct. 7.The explosion shook Musharafieh, one of the Lebanese capital's southern suburbs, which are a stronghold of the militant Hezbollah group, which is an ally of Hamas. The explosion caused fire in Hadi Nasrallah street south of Beirut.The explosion came during more than two months of heavy exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and members of Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border.Since the fighting began on Oct. 8, the fighting has been concentrated a few miles (kilometers) from the border but on several occasions Israel’s air force hit Hezbollah targets deeper in Lebanon.Earlier in the day, Hezbollah said its fighters carried out several attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border targeting Israeli military posts.",

        "body_text": "Volodymyr Zelensky was already a celebrity when his first child was born in 2004. Back then, he and his wife Olena Zelenska often lived apart. He spent his days touring and promoting his comedy troupe in Kyiv, while she often stayed with her parents in their hometown of Kryvyi Rih, the city that Zelensky would later credit with forging his character. “My big soul, my big heart,” he once called it. “Everything I have I got from there.”The name of the town translates as “Crooked Horn,” and in conversation Zelensky and his wife tend to refer to it in Russian as Krivoy—“the crooked place,” where both of them were born in the winter of 1978, about two weeks apart.Few if any places in Ukraine had a worse reputation in those years for violence and urban decay. The main employer in the city was the metallurgical plant, whose gargantuan blast furnaces churned out more hot steel than any other facility in the Soviet Union. During World War II, the plant was leveled by the Luftwaffe as the Nazis began their occupation of Ukraine. It was rebuilt in the 1950s and ’60s, and many thousands of veterans went to work there. So did convicts released from Soviet labor camps.Read More: How Volodymyr Zelensky Defended Ukraine and United the WorldMost of them settled into blocks of industrial housing, hives of reinforced concrete that offered almost nothing in the way of leisure, culture, or self-development. There were not nearly enough theaters, gyms, or sports facilities to occupy the local kids. By the late 1980s, when the population peaked at over 750,000, the city devolved into what Zelensky would later describe as a “banditsky gorod”—a city of bandits.Olena remembers it more fondly than that. “It wasn’t full of bandits in my eyes,” she told me. “Maybe boys and girls run in different circles when they’re growing up. But yes, it’s true. There was a period in the ’90s when there was a lot of crime, especially among young people. There were gangs.”The boys who joined these gangs, mostly teenagers, were known as beguny—literally, “runners”—because groups of them would run through the streets, beating and stabbing their rivals, flipping over cars, and smashing windows. Some of the gangs were known for using homemade explosives and improvised firearms, which they learned to fashion out of metal pipes stuffed with gunpowder and fishhooks. “Some of them got killed,” Olena said. According to local news reports, the death toll reached into the dozens by the mid-1990s.Many more runners were maimed, beaten with clubs, or blinded with shrapnel from their homemade bombs. “Every neighborhood was in on it,” the First Lady said. “When kids of a certain age wandered into the wrong neighborhood, they could run up against a question: What part of town you from? And then the problems could start.” It was nearly impossible, she said, for teenage boys to avoid joining one of the gangs. “You could even be walking home in your own part of town, and they’d come up and ask what gang you’re with, what are you doing here. Just being on your own was scary. It wasn’t done.”The gangs had their heyday in the late 1980s, when there were dozens of them around the city, with thousands of runners in all. Many of those who survived into the 1990s graduated into organized crime, which flourished in Kryvyi Rih during the sudden transition from communism to capitalism. Parts of the city turned into wastelands of racketeers and alcoholics. But Zelensky, thanks in large part to his family, avoided the pull of the streets.His paternal grandfather, Semyon Zelensky, served as a senior officer in the city’s police force, investigating organized crime or, as his grandson later put it, “catching bad guys.” Stories of his service in the Second World War made a profound impression on the young Zelensky, as did the traumas of the Holocaust. Both sides of his family are Jewish, and they lost many of their own during the war.Read More: Historians on What Putin Gets Wrong About ‘Denazification’ in UkraineHis mother’s side of the family survived in large part because they were evacuated to Central Asia as the German occupation began in 1941. The following year, when he was still a teenager, Semyon Zelensky went to fight in the Red Army and wound up in command of a mortar platoon. All three of his brothers fought in the war, and none of them survived. Neither did their parents, Zelensky’s great-grandparents, who were killed during the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, along with over a million other Ukrainian Jews, in what became known as the “Holocaust by Bullets.”Around their kitchen table, Zelensky’s relatives often brought up these tragedies and the crimes of the German occupiers. But little was ever said about the torments that Joseph Stalin inflicted on Ukraine. As a child, Zelensky remembers his grandmothers talking in vague terms about the years when Soviet soldiers came to confiscate the food grown in Ukraine, its vast harvests of grain and wheat all carted away at gunpoint. It was part of Stalin’s attempt in the early 1930s to remake Soviet society, and it led to a catastrophic famine known as the Holodomor—“murder by hunger”—that killed at least 3 million people in Ukraine.In Soviet schools, the topic was taboo, including the schools where both of Zelensky’s grandmothers worked as teachers; one taught the Ukrainian language, the other taught Russian. When it came to the famine, Zelensky said, “They talked about it very carefully, that there was this period when the state took away everything, all the food.”If they harbored any ill will toward Soviet authorities, Zelensky’s family knew better than to voice it in public. But his father Oleksandr, a stocky man of stubborn principles, refused throughout his life to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. “He was categorically against it,” Zelensky told me, “even though that definitely hurt his career.” As a professor of cybernetics, Oleksandr Zelensky worked most of his life in the fields of mining and geology. Zelensky’s mother Rymma, an engineer by training, was closer to their only son and gentler toward him, doting on the boy much more often than she punished him.In 1982, when Zelensky was 4 years old, his father accepted a prestigious job at a mining development in northern Mongolia, and the family moved to the town of Erdenet, which had been founded only eight years earlier to exploit one of the world’s largest deposits of copper. (The name of the town in Mongolian means “with treasure.”) The job was well paid by Soviet standards, but it forced the family to endure the pollution around the mines and the hardships of life in a frontier town. The food was bland and unfamiliar. Fermented horse milk was a local staple, and the family’s diet was heavy on mutton, with the occasional summer watermelon for which Zelensky and his mother had to stand in line for hours.Read More: How Ukraine is Pioneering New Ways to Prosecute War CrimesRymma, who was slender and frail, with a long nose and beautiful features, found her health deteriorating in the harsh climate, and she soon decided to move back to Ukraine. Zelensky was a first-grader in a Mongolian school, just beginning to pick up the local language, when they traveled home in 1987. His father stayed behind, and for the next 15 years—virtually all of Zelensky’s childhood—he split his time between Erdenet, where he continued to develop his automated system for managing the mines, and Kryvyi Rih, where he taught computer science at a local university. Zelensky’s parents were often separated in those years by five time zones and around 6,000 kilometers. Even at that distance, his father continued to be a dominant presence in Zelensky’s life.“My parents gave me no free time,” he later said. “They were always signing me up for something.” His father enrolled Zelensky in one of his math courses at the university and began to prime the boy for a career in computer science. His mother sent him to piano lessons, ballroom-dance classes, and gymnastics. To make sure he could hold his own against the local toughs, Zelensky’s parents also got him into a class for Greco-Roman wrestling.None of these activities were really his choice, but he went along with them out of a sense of duty to his parents. “They were always quick with the discipline,” he said. The approach his father took to education was particularly severe. Zelensky called it “maximalist.” But it was typical of Jewish families in the Soviet Union, who often felt that overachievement was the only way to get a fair shake in a system rigged against them. “You have to be better than everyone else,” Zelensky said in summarizing his parents’ approach to education. “Then there might be a space for you left among the best.”Zelensky was the product of an era of change. He was too young to experience the Soviet Union as the stagnant, repressive gerontocracy his parents had known. By the time he returned to Ukraine with his mother, the stage was set for the empire’s collapse. Moscow was broke. Its grand experiment in socialism had failed. Mikhail Gorbachev, the reluctant reformer with the soft southern accent, had already begun his doomed attempts to reform the system without breaking it apart.Even for someone Zelensky’s age, these changes were hard to miss. He could see them in the empty grocery shelves, the endless lines for basic goods, like sausage and toilet paper. And he saw them, clear as day, on television. Under Gorbachev, the censors on Soviet TV became a lot more permissive, reflecting the wider push to relax the state’s control over the media. One of the most popular TV shows of the era was known as KVN, which stands for “The Club of the Funny and Inventive.”It was a comedy show, but not the kind that most people in the U.S. and Europe would associate with that term. This was not the stand-up of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy. There was no minimalism here, no lonely cynic at the microphone, breaking taboos. KVN was more like a sports league for young comedians. It involved competing troupes of performers, often made up of college students, doing sketch acts and improv in front of a panel of judges, who decided at the end of the show which team was the funniest.By the mid-1990s, the average university and many high schools in the Russian-speaking world had at least one KVN team. Many big cities had a dozen or more, all facing off in local competitions and vying for a place in the championship league. The material was mostly wooden, with a lot of knee slappers and humdingers. The teams were also expected to sing and dance. Still, in its own hokey way, KVN could be fun to watch. For Zelensky and his friends, it was an obsession.Read More: Inside Zelensky’s WorldMost of them went to School No. 95, about a block from the central bazaar in their hometown, and not far from the university where Zelensky’s father worked as a professor. Between classes and after school, they rehearsed sketches and comedy routines, riffing off the ones they saw in the professional league on TV. “We loved it all, the KVN, the humor, and we just did it for the soul, for the fun of it,” said Vadym Pereverzev, who met Zelensky in their seventh-grade English class.The top KVN competitions in Moscow also offered a ticket to stardom that seemed a lot more accessible to them than Hollywood, and a lot more fun than the careers available to kids in a dead-end town like theirs. “It was a rough, working-class place, and you just wanted to escape,” Pereverzev told me. “I think that was one of our main motivations.”Their amateur shows in the school auditorium soon got the attention of a local comedy troupe that performed at a theater for college students. One of them, Oleksandr Pikalov, a handsome kid with an infectious, dimply smile, came down to School No. 95 to scout the talent. He happened upon a rehearsal in which Zelensky played a fried egg, with something stuffed under his shirt to represent the yolk. The act impressed Pikalov, and they soon began performing together.Two years older and already in college, Pikalov introduced Zelensky to a few of the movers and shakers from the local comedy scene, including the Shefir brothers, Boris and Serhiy, who were both around 30 years old at the time. They saw Zelensky’s potential, and they became his lifelong friends, mentors, producers, and, eventually, political advisers.Around their neighborhood in the 1990s, Zelensky’s crew stood out from the start. Instead of the track pants and leather jackets that local hoodlums wore to school, their look was a kind of ’50s retro: plaid blazers and polka-dot ties, slacks with suspenders, pressed white shirts, long hair slicked back with too much gel. Zelensky wore a ring in his ear. At a time when Nirvana was on the radio, he and his friends sang Beatles songs and listened to old-timey rock ’n’ roll.To them this felt like a form of rebellion, mostly because it was their own. Nobody acted like that in their city, and it didn’t always go over well. Once, in his late teens, Zelensky wanted to try busking in an underpass with his guitar. He had seen people do it in the movies. It looked romantic. But Pikalov warned him that he wouldn’t make it past the second song before somebody came over to kick his ass.“Sure enough, half an hour goes by,” Pikalov told me. “Somebody comes over and busts the guitar.” But Zelensky was laughing. He had won the bet. “He said he made it through the third song.”Soon his performances caught the attention of his future wife, Olena. The two of them had crossed paths in the hallways of School No. 95 in Kryvyi Rih. But their homeroom classes were rivals—“like the Montagues and the Capulets,” she once told the Guardian. It was only after graduation, when Zelensky was on his way to becoming a local celebrity, that they took a liking to each other.Olena was also involved in the KVN scene. To make the connection, Pikalov, their mutual friend, borrowed a videocassette from her, a copy of Basic Instinct, and Zelensky used it as an excuse to visit her at home and return the tape. “Then we became more than friends,” she later told me. “We were also creative colleagues.” Their performances began winning competitions around Kryvyi Rih and in other parts of Ukraine. “We were together all the time,” Olena said. “And everything sort of developed in parallel.”Their big break came at the end of 1997, when they performed at an international KVN contest in Moscow. More than 200 teams took part from around the former Soviet Union, and Zelensky’s team, then called Transit, tied for first place with a rival team from Armenia. It was a remarkable debut for Zelensky, but he felt robbed. A video survives of him in that period, a teenage heartthrob with a raspy voice, wiping his palms against his knees as he explains his anger to the camera: the show-runner had cheated, he said, by refusing to let the judges break the tie.Though he catalogued such gripes with an endearing smile, Zelensky was clearly unwilling to share the crown with anyone. He needed to win. Years later, when he recalled these competitions from his childhood, Zelensky admitted that, for him, “Losing is worse than death.”Read More: TIME’s Interview with Volodymyr ZelenskyEven if the championship in Moscow did not end in an outright victory for Zelensky, it put him within reach of stardom. One of his team members, Olena Kravets, said they could hardly imagine getting that kind of opportunity. To young comedians from a place like Kryvyi Rih, she said, the major league of KVN “was not just the foot of Mount Parnassus”—the home of the muses in Greek mythology—“this was Parnassus itself.”Its summit stood in the northern part of Moscow, in the studios and greenrooms around the Ostankino television tower, home to the biggest broadcasters in the Russian-speaking world. The major league of KVN had its main production headquarters there, and Zelensky soon made it inside. The year after their breakout performance in Moscow, they competed for the first time under the name Kvartal 95—or District 95, a nod to the neighborhood where they grew up.Along with the Shefir brothers, who served as the team’s lead writers and producers, Zelensky soon rented an apartment in the north of Moscow and devoted himself to -becoming the champion. For all KVN teams, that required winning the favor of the league’s perennial master of ceremonies, Alexander Maslyakov. A dapper old man with a Cheshire smile, Maslyakov owned the rights to the KVN brand and hosted all the biggest competitions. His nickname among the performers was the Baron, and he and his wife, the Baroness, ran the league like a family business.“KVN was their empire,” Pereverzev told me. “It was their show.” At first, the Baron took a liking to Zelensky and his crew, granting them admission to the biggest stage in Moscow and the touches of fame that it brought. But there were hundreds of other teams vying for his attention, and the competition among them was vicious. “Everyone there lived with this constant emotional tension,” Olena Zelenska told me. “You were always told to know your place. The whole time we were performing in Moscow, they always told us: ‘Remember where you came from. Learn to hold a microphone. This is Central Television. You should feel lucky.’ And that’s how all the teams lived, though not so much the lucky ones from Moscow. They were loved.”In the major league of KVN, Zelensky came face-to-face with a brand of Russian chauvinism that would, in far uglier form, manifest itself about two decades later in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As Zelenska put it when we talked about the KVN league, “Those who were not from Moscow were always treated like slaves.”The informal hierarchy, she said, corresponded to Moscow’s vision of itself as an imperial capital. “Teams from Ukraine were of course even farther down the ladder than all the Russian cities. They could, for instance, put up with Ryazan”—a city in western Russia—“but a place like Kryvyi Rih was something else. They’d never even seen it on a map. So we always needed to prove ourselves.”The unwritten rules within the league reflected the role KVN played in the Russian-speaking world. Amid the ruins of the Soviet Union, it stood out as a rare institution of culture that still bound Moscow to its former vassal states. It gave kids a reason to stay within Russia’s cultural matrix rather than gravitating westward, toward Hollywood. The league had outposts in every corner of the former empire, from Moldova to Tajikistan, and all of them performed in the Russian language.Even teams from the Baltic states, the first countries to break away from Moscow’s rule in 1990 and 1991, took part in the KVN league; its biggest annual gathering was held in Latvia, on the shores of the Baltic Sea. Viewed in a generous light, these contests could be seen as a vehicle for Russian soft power in much the same way that American movies defined what good guys and bad guys are supposed to look like for viewers around the world. To be less generous, the league could be construed as a Kremlin-backed program of cultural colonialism.In either case, the center of gravity for KVN was always Moscow, and nostalgia for the Soviet Union was a touchstone for every team that hoped to win. Zelensky’s team was no exception, especially since their best shot at victory in the early 2000s coincided with a change of power in the Kremlin. With the election of Vladimir Putin in 2000, the Russian state embraced the symbols and icons of its imperial past, and it encouraged its people to stop being ashamed of the Soviet Union. One of Putin’s first acts in office was to change the melody of the Russian national anthem back to the Soviet one.When it came to KVN, Putin was always an ardent supporter. He often attended KVN championships, and he liked to take the stage and offer pep talks to the performers. In return, they made him the occasional subject of jokes, though none were ever very pointed. One of the first, when he was still the Prime Minister in 1999, made fun of his soaring poll numbers after the Russian bombing campaign of Chechnya began that summer: “His popularity has already outpaced that of Mickey Mouse,” said the performer, “and is approaching that of Beavis and Butt-Head.”Seated in the hall next to his bodyguard, Putin snickered and slumped in his chair. Less than a year later, he made clear that sharper jokes in his direction would not be tolerated. In February 2000, during Putin’s first presidential campaign, a satirical TV show called Kukly, or Puppets, depicted him as a gnome whose evil spell makes people believe he is a beautiful princess. Several of Putin’s campaign surrogates called for the Russian authors of the sketch to be imprisoned. The show soon got canceled, and the network that aired it was taken over by a state-run firm.Read More: Column: How Putin Cannibalizes Russian Economy to Survive PersonallyZelensky, living and working in Moscow at the time, watched the turn toward authoritarianism in Russia with the same concern as all his peers in show business, and, like everyone else, he adapted. To stay on top, his team understood it would not be wise to make fun of Russia’s new leader. During one sketch in 2001, Zelensky’s character appealed to Putin as the decider “not only of my fate, but that of all Ukraine.” A year later, in a performance that brimmed with nostalgia for the Soviet Union, a member of Zelensky’s team said Putin “turned out to be a decent guy.”But such direct references to the Russian President were rare in Zelensky’s early comedy. More often he joked about the fraught relationship between Ukraine and Russia, as in his most famous sketch from 2001, performed during the Ukrainian KVN championships. Titled “Man Born to Dance,” it cast Zelensky in the role of a Russian who can’t stop dancing as he tells a Ukrainian about his life. The script is bland and the humor juvenile. Zelensky grabs his crotch like Michael Jackson and borrows the mime-in-a-box routine from Bip the Clown.At the end of the scene, the Russian and the Ukrainian take turns humping each other from behind. “Ukraine is always screwing Russia,” says Zelensky. “And Russia always screws Ukraine.” The punch line did not come close to the kind of satire Putin’s Russia needed and deserved. But as a piece of physical comedy, the sketch is memorable, even brilliant. Zelensky’s movements, much more than his words, seem to infect the audience with a kind of wide-mouthed glee as he shimmies and high-kicks his way through the lines in a pair of skintight leather pants.The most magnetic thing about the sketch is him, the grin on his face, the obvious pleasure he gets from every second on the stage. The judges loved it, and that night, before a TV audience of millions, Zelensky’s team became the undisputed champions of the league in their native Ukraine. But, on the biggest stages in Moscow, victory would continue to elude them, and their troupe did not last long in the major leagues of KVN.After competing and losing in the international championships three years in a row, they gathered up their props and left Moscow in 2003. Members of Zelensky's team agree their departure was far from amicable, though they all seem to remember it a little differently. One of them told me the breaking point with KVN was an antisemitic slur. During a rehearsal, a Russian producer stood on the stage and said loudly, in reference to Zelensky, “Where’s that little yid?”In Zelensky’s version of the story, the management in Moscow offered him a job as a producer and writer on Russian television. It would require him to disband his troupe and send them back to Ukraine without him. Zelensky refused, and they all went home together. Halfway through their 20s, they were now successful showmen and celebrities across Ukraine. But it was still difficult for Zelensky’s parents to accept comedy as his career.“Without a doubt,” his father said years later, “we advised him to do something different, and we thought the interest in KVN was temporary, that he would change, that he would choose a profession. After all, he’s a lawyer. He finished our institute.” Indeed, Zelensky had completed his studies and earned a law degree while performing in KVN. But he had no intention of practicing law. He found it boring.When he got back home to Ukraine, Zelensky and his friends staged a series of weddings in their hometown of Kryvyi Rih, three Saturdays in a row. Olena Kiyashko married Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 6, 2003, and Pikalov and Pereverzev married their respective girlfriends. By the end of the year, when Olena was pregnant with their daughter, Zelensky moved to Kyiv to build up his new production company, Studio Kvartal 95.Even at this early stage in his career, Zelensky’s confidence went beyond the typical swagger of a young man smitten with success. He betrayed no doubts in his team’s ability to make it big, and if he felt any fear he hid it from everyone, including his wife. For an expectant father in his mid-20s, the job offered to him in Moscow must have been more tempting than he let on. Apart from the money, it would have placed him among the glitterati, the producers and showrunners in the biggest market in the Russian-speaking world.Read More: Inside Zelensky’s Plan to Beat Putin’s Propaganda in Russian-Occupied UkraineInstead he took a risk and struck out in a much smaller pond, relying on the team of friends who looked to him for leadership and made him feel at home wherever he went. Upon arriving in Kyiv, Zelensky scored a meeting with one of the country’s biggest media executives, Alexander Rodnyansky, the head of the network that produced and broadcast the KVN league in Ukraine. The executive knew Zelensky from that circuit as a “bright young Jewish kid,” he told me. But he didn’t expect the kid to stride into his office with a risky business proposition.Accompanied by the Shefir brothers, who were a decade older and more experienced in the industry, Zelensky did the talking. He wanted to appear with his troupe on the biggest stage in Kyiv for a nationally televised performance, and he needed Rodnyansky to give him the airtime and bankroll part of the production, marketing, and other costs. “The chutzpah on this guy, that’s what I remember,” the executive told me. “He had this bulletproof belief in himself, with these burning eyes.”Many years later, Rodnyansky would come to see the danger hidden in that quality. It would lead Zelensky to the false belief that in the role of President, he could outmaneuver Putin and negotiate his way out of a full-scale war. “I think that confidence of his betrayed him in the end,” he said. But at the time, Zelensky’s charm won out in the negotiations with Rodnyansky, who agreed to take a risk on the performance.It proved to be such a success that, shortly after, the team at Kvartal 95 reached a deal to make a series of variety shows that would air in Russia and Ukraine. Their tone departed from the more wholesome, aw-shucks style of KVN. The jokes took on a harder edge, and they became much more overtly political. Pereverzev, who was a writer on the shows, told me their aim was to make a version of Saturday Night Live with elements of Monty Python.It was an untested concept on Ukrainian TV. There was no way to tell whether the audience was ready. “That was Green’s style,” he said, using Zelensky’s nickname. (The word for “green” in Ukrainian and Russian is the same: zeleny.) “That was his main quality as a leader. He’d just say, ‘Let’s do it.’ Then we’d all get scared, and he would just tell us to trust him. All our lives it was like that. And at some point we just started to trust him, because when he said it would work out, it did.” Excerpted from THE SHOWMAN: Inside the Invasion That Shook the World and Made a Leader of Volodymyr Zelensky by Simon Shuster, to be published January 23 by William Morrow.

        "title_text": "16-Year-Old Luke Littler Loses to Luke Humphries at the World Darts Championship",
        "body_text": "It’s been a wild ride, to say the least, for Luke Littler, the 16-year-old darts wunderkind who exploded in popularity in recent weeks as he vaulted his way into the ranks of the world’s greatest players. After shattering records and defeating rivals twice his age to become the youngest competitor in the World Darts Championship finals, Littler ultimately lost to Luke Humphries (7-4) during Wednesday’s competition.Over the past weeks, he has taken down even the most seasoned darts players—including former world champions. Littler will face world No. 1 Luke Humphries at Wednesday’s finals.Along with Littler’s newfound fame, the relatively niche professional sport—perhaps better known as a bar-favorite pastime—is enjoying a fresh surge of interest. Here’s what to know about Luke Littler and the World Darts Championship.Nicknamed “The Nuke,” Littler already made history last week as the youngest-ever player to reach the semi-finals of the World Darts Championship—before outdoing that record by making the finals this week. Until Littler came along, the previous title of the youngest World Championship finalist belonged to Kirk Shepherd, who was 21 years old when he was named the 2008 runner-up.Littler stunned observers when he defeated former world champion Rob Cross 6-2 at the semi-finals on Tuesday. “He’s got the darting world at his feet,” Sky Sports commentator Wayne Mardle remarked at Littler’s victory. Mardle also said that the teenager was “probably the most naturally gifted player I have ever seen in my life.”“I have no words, it’s just crazy to think I’m in a World Championship final in my debut,” Littler told Sky Sports. “I was happy winning one game but I could go all the way.”“Rob told me ‘God bless, you’re a step away, do it,’” he said. Cross had won the World Championship on his debut six years ago.On Saturday, Littler beat five-time world champion Raymond Van Barneveld to enter the quarter-finals. 56-year-old Van Barneveld, who has been playing competitively since 1984, was described by Littler as one of his idols.Littler, who lives in the English town of Warrington, was only 18 months old when he started throwing darts on a magnetic board. He has been playing “non-stop” ever since, he told the BBC. The 28-year-old, nicknamed “Cool Hand Luke,” has been on a roll since October, sweeping major titles at the World Grand Prix, Grand Slam of Darts, and Players Championship Finals. He was ranked world No. 1—the first time in his career—after a 6-0 victory over Scott Williams in Tuesday’s semi-finals.And despite Littler’s comparative inexperience, Humphries did not let his guard down against his young rival at the finals.\"Nothing is going to faze him. If he plays like he did tonight, tomorrow is not going to faze him at all, so I will probably have to play the game of my life,” Humphries told Sky Sports ahead of the competition.One of the biggest tournaments on the darting calendar, the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) World Darts Championship, first held in 1994, typically starts in December and extends into the new year. As crowds pack into Alexandra Palace—the historic entertainment venue where the darts championship has been held since 2008—the atmosphere is usually one of less nail-biting and more glass-clinking.Observing the competition’s fun tradition, spectators have shown up to the matches in outlandish costumes ranging from elves to dinosaurs to King Charles—most with pints in hand throughout the night.“You’re not supporting anyone; you’re just cheering when something good happens,” one fan told CNN. “The sport is secondary.”Still, for world class players, a game of darts is a serious sporting pursuit that requires near-perfect precision. Players each start with 501 points and try to be the first to deduct the points to zero. They do this by throwing three darts with every turn and, calculated according to where the darts land on the board, having the sum of the three scores deducted from their total number of points. To win the game, players must finish by throwing a double—that is, landing the dart on a specific ring on the board.The winner of the PDC World Darts Championship gets a prize of £500,000 ($631,000) while the runner-up gets £200,000 ($253,000). Semi-finalists go home with £100,000 ($126,000).Winners of the PDC World Darts Championship also receive the Sid Waddell Trophy, named after the late commentator popularly known as the “Voice of Darts.”Though Littler fell short of securing the championship this year, it’s clear his career is just beginning. As Humphries said,  “All day, in the back of my mind, I’ve been thinking, ‘Get this won now because he’s gonna dominate world darts soon!’”And as for Littler, he’s already looking ahead to the next competition. “I might not get to a final for another 5-10 years, we don’t know, but I can say I’m a runner-up,” he said following the match, \"I just want to go and win it.\" ",

        "title_text": "Iran Says At Least 103 People Killed in Blasts at Ceremony Honoring Slain General",
        "body_text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Two explosions minutes apart Wednesday in Iran targeted a commemoration for a prominent general slain in a U.S. drone strike in 2020, killing at least 103 people and wounding at least 141 others as the Middle East remains on edge over Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.No group immediately claimed responsibility for what Iranian state media called a “terroristic\" attack shortly after the blasts in Kerman, about 820 kilometers (510 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran.While Israel has carried out attacks in Iran over its nuclear program, it has conducted targeted assassinations, not mass-casualty bombings. Sunni extremist groups including the Islamic State group have conducted large-scale attacks in the past that killed civilians in Shiite-majority Iran, though not in relatively peaceful Kerman.Iran also has seen mass protests in recent years, including those over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in 2022. The country also has been targeted by exile groups in attacks dating back to the turmoil surrounding its 1979 Islamic Revolution.The blasts struck an event marking the the fourth anniversary of the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force. who died in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020. The explosions occurred near his grave site in Kerman,Iranian state television quoted Babak Yektaparast, a spokesman for the country’s emergency services, for the casualty figure. Authorities said some people were injured while fleeing afterward.Footage suggested that the second blast occurred some 15 minutes after the first. A delayed second explosion is often used by militants to target emergency personnel responding to the scene and inflict more casualties.People could be heard screaming in state TV footage.Kerman’s deputy governor, Rahman Jalali, called the attack “terroristic,” without elaborating. Iran has multiple foes who could be behind the assault, including exile groups, militant organizations and state actors. Iran has supported Hamas as well as the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels.Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional military activities and is hailed as a national icon among supporters of Iran’s theocracy. He also helped secure Syrian President Bashar Assad's government after the 2011 Arab Spring protests against him turned into a civil, and later a regional, war that still rages today.Relatively unknown in Iran until the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Soleimani’s popularity and mystique grew after American officials called for his killing over his help arming militants with penetrating roadside bombs that killed and maimed U.S. troops.A decade and a half later, Soleimani had become Iran’s most recognizable battlefield commander, ignoring calls to enter politics but growing as powerful, if not more, than its civilian leadership.Ultimately, a drone strike launched by the Trump administration killed the general, part of escalating incidents that followed America's 2018 unilateral withdrawal from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.Soleimani's death has drawn large processions in the past. At his funeral in 2020, a stampede broke out in Kerman and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession. Otherwise, Kerman largely has been untouched in the recent unrest and attacks that have struck Iran. The city and province of the same name sits in Iran's central desert plateau.",

        "title_text": "Biden Must Push Netanyahu",
        "body_text": "In less turbulent times, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was known by the nickname Mr. Security, but in the aftermath of Hamas’ murderous October 7 assault on Israel, the better moniker for Netanyahu might be Dr. No. In recent weeks, Netanyahu has repeatedly laid out the things that he is not willing to accept; no to Palestinian statehood, no to a Palestinian Authority role in Gaza, no to transferring the full tax revenues to the PA that Israel collects on its behalf under the Oslo agreements, no to allowing Palestinians from the West Bank with work permits to resume working in Israel. In his Wall Street Journal op-ed on December 25, Netanyahu laid out three amorphous \"prerequisites for peace\": 1) destroy Hamas; 2) demilitarize Gaza; 3) deradicalize Palestinian society. In addition to shockingly ignoring the plight of Israel's hostages still held by Hamas, Netanyahu failed to provide any vision for how Israel would marshal international or region support to achieve his lofty objectives.Netanyahu understandably views October 7 and Israel’s military operation in Gaza as a crisis, and is seemingly focused on limiting the fallout. But the shocking nature of Hamas’ attack and the new world that it has spurred in Gaza has also created new opportunities that Israel has long sought, and by harping on what can go wrong rather than what can go right, Netanyahu is squandering a chance that may not return for a long time.Israel has long sought the international community’s support on a number of issues, which it has found hard to secure. Israel has warned for years about Iranian aid for Hamas and Hezbollah, and sounded the alarm on international assistance to Gaza being captured by Hamas for tunnel construction and weapons manufacturing. It has pushed for an end to Palestinian Authority martyr and prisoner payments and for donors to the PA to take more seriously the issue of PA incitement in textbooks and media. It has worked to create a more integrated region in which Israel is a full participant, and counted on growing defense and economic relationships to make regional normalization feel inevitable rather than remote. While the Abraham Accords was a clear success for normalization, other states have not yet followed suit, and Israel has remained frustrated that its complaints about the Iranian axis and PA incitement only find infrequent receptive audiences.Read More: Finding Common Ground Between Israelis and PalestiniansIsrael’s fight against Hamas has the ability to gain Israel more willing allies on these fronts. None of the pragmatic Sunni states want Iranian influence to grow or its proxies to retain their ability to sow chaos. Israeli diplomats insist that the private messages they receive across the region are clear support for Israel to destroy Hamas. The October 7 attacks also demonstrated the danger of letting unbridled incitement fester, and in an environment in which frustration with the PA across the region was already high, there has never been a more auspicious moment to push for genuine PA reforms. Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping have already sparked a U.S.-led coalition to protect freedom of navigation, and only reinforce the imperative to have Israel be part of region-wide security solutions and for normalization to keep moving forward. Israel is in a position to advance many of its policy priorities with the cooperation of current and future partners.Yet Netanyahu’s constant refusal to discuss a political horizon for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and his endless harangues against the PA are making it difficult, if not impossible, to gain international support for these priorities. Nobody is going to press the PA on governance, transparency, or incitement when Netanyahu is trying to have “Fatahstan” enter the lexicon rather than set out attainable goals for what Israel would need in order to support a PA role in Gaza. Nobody is going to take the steps that would precede new normalization agreements when Netanyahu is rebuffing Arab states demands on a two-state political process and also insisting that they should fund Gaza reconstruction with no questions asked or strings attached. Iran and its proxies are not going to be deterred when visiting high-ranking U.S. officials repeatedly lay out their vision for a post-war Gaza and Israeli cabinet members fall over each other in their rush to the television studios to offer public rebuttals. Israel has an opportunity to get widespread cooperation on a range of its priorities, and is instead guaranteeing a future of going it alone. President Biden is understandably growing frustrated.As has always been the case with Israeli-Palestinian issues, the absence of progress will not also mean the absence of deterioration. As Netanyahu does all he can to prevent any sort of proactive solution for Gaza, the void will be filled by extremists. Not only does it risk a Hamas resurgence or the rise of an even more radical entity, but likelier is an inescapable Israeli occupation and a right-wing campaign to rebuild settlements in Gaza. Should that happen, cooperation that seemed inevitable in a pre-October 7 world will not materialize, and existing relationships may even be rolled back.President Biden should push Netanyahu and the Israeli government to take a more pliable view of the opportunities of the moment, and not to focus solely on the risks. The U.S. should not waste time on multilateral efforts like the Negev Forum or convene donor conferences for Gaza reconstruction until Netanyahu sets out a proactive political vision for the post-war period that is compatible with the priorities of states in the region; otherwise the U.S. will be left spinning its wheels. While this will cause more friction between the U.S. and Israel at a time when both sides are trying to maintain a united front, there is widespread political support in the U.S. among both parties for real PA reform and for the spread of regional normalization. It is clear that these priorities—both of which benefit Israel and which Israel supports—require some measure of Israeli compromise, and the Biden Administration should not be shy about taking a tougher public line with Israel, not for the purpose of creating distance but for the purpose of improving the regional architecture in ways that even Netanyahu acknowledges would be to Israel’s benefit. Netanyahu has always been more comfortable saying no than he has in taking the initiative. It is up to the U.S. to get him to where Israel needs to be.",

        "title_text": "A Make-or-Break Year for Democracy Worldwide",
        "body_text": "Elections are no guarantee of democracy. That much we know from who holds them. Even full-blown tyrants crave the legitimacy that, in the modern era, can be provided only by the ballot box—margins of victory doubling as one more tool of intimidation.But it’s also true that democracy does not exist without elections, which is why the year ahead carries such significance. In 2024, more than half the world’s population will go to polls—4.2 billion citizens across approximately 65 countries in what, from a distance, at least appears to be a stirring spectacle of self-government. At closer range, however, the picture is cloudier, and warning lights flash red from the murk.“2024 may be the make-or-break year for democracy in the world,” says Staffan Lindberg, the director of the Varieties of Democracy, or V-Dem, Institute, a Swedish think tank that analyzes the “complexity of the concept of democracy.”Lindberg says that more than the sheer number of elections, or the fact that many of the countries holding them have global influence, the worry is that “so many have now empowered leaders or parties with antidemocratic leanings.”Read More: All the Elections Around the World in 2024Around the world, including in some of the biggest and most influential countries, experts have observed that the space for political competition and civil society is shrinking. At the same time, elected but illiberal leaders are cracking down on opponents and critics, eroding democratic institutions like the judiciary and the media that serve as a check on their power, and, finally, consolidating that power through changes in the constitution. When the leader next stands for office, it’s in an election that may ostensibly be free but is no longer fair.The process is already well along in much of the world. Of the 43 countries expected to hold free and fair elections this electoral megacycle, 28 do not actually meet the essential conditions for a democratic vote, according to the Democracy Index from the Economist’s Intelligence Unit. And eight of the 10 most populous countries in the world, including India, Mexico, and the U.S.—all of which head to the polls this year—are grappling with the challenge of ensuring voter participation, free speech, and electoral independence while authoritarianism is on the rise.“What does it mean to have a free and fair election? Is it possible to have a free but unfair election? And how unfair does it have to be to no longer be democratic?” asks Yana Gorokhovskaia, a research director at Freedom House who oversees the pro-democracy think tank’s annual “Freedom in the World” report, the latest edition of which recorded a 17th consecutive year of global decline.The American presidential contest looms largest, and not only because the U.S. is the world’s longest-standing democracy. The challenger leading in early Republican polling, Donald Trump, hopes to once again secure the office that he refused to vacate after losing to Joe Biden four years earlier—precipitating a physical insurrection on the day Congress was validating the result. Trump is campaigning while under indictment on charges related to Jan. 6, among other allegations.In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is running for a third term in the world’s largest democracy. During his second term, Freedom House downgraded the country’s democracy rating from “free” to “partly free,” as the government targeted critics and news media, and continued a campaign against the Muslim minority.Bangladesh is widely expected to re-elect 76-year-old Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina—the country’s longest-serving leader and world’s longest-serving female head of government—who has cracked down on her political opponents. And in November, Tunisia’s presidential contest could see incumbent President Kais Saied further tighten his grip on power as he pulls the country once regarded as the best hope for democratization in the Middle East back to authoritarianism.Read More: Sheikh Hasina and the Future of Democracy in BangladeshIn Russia, which has led the way on mis- and disinformation, and where Vladimir Putin is all but certain to secure a fifth term in office, electoral contests have largely become pro forma, with all meaningful opposition thrown behind bars. “Even autocrats acknowledge that legitimacy comes through elections,” notes Gorokhovskaia.Attacks on free and fair elections bring forth the reminder that even in the most advanced democracy, necessary work must be done to shore up institutions such as electoral bodies, the judiciary, and even the media.“All these elections that are taking place in 2024 are going to be confronting some version of attacks against democracy, attacks against electoral integrity,” says Tony Banbury, the president and chief executive of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, which provides technical assistance for elections in more than 145 countries. “Without that kind of proactive work to defend democracy, there is going to be backsliding.”Populist leaders pose particular challenges to democratic norms, as do hyperpolarization and growing distrust abetted by mis- and disinformation, which is now being proliferated at a faster rate than ever before because of generative artificial intelligence. In Mexico, for example, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been seen amplifying false and misleading information against his opponent Xóchitl Gálvez ahead of the country’s June elections.“We’ve seen how much authoritarians have capitalized on using some of these tools to push out their propaganda,” says Katie Harbath, the founder and CEO of Anchor Change, a firm that advises politicians and governments on the intersection of tech and policy.Some companies like Facebook and Google have instituted mechanisms to help protect the integrity of elections online, but Harbath says any platforms that haven’t are bound to be exploited by bad-faith actors. “They’re moving to the ones that either don’t have the resources or aren’t willing to put in the time and effort,” she warns. The E.U.’s Digital Safety Act and the U.K.’s Online Safety Bill, which were both enacted in 2023, now outline the obligations of platforms to combat hate speech and misinformation.But that doesn’t necessarily cover the emerging threat of AI—the impact of which is already being felt. In the U.S., Trump shared a manipulated video using AI voice-cloning of CNN host Anderson Cooper last May. During elections in Slovakia last September, pro-Kremlin social media accounts shared AI-generated audio recordings, known as deepfakes, of journalists and politicians allegedly discussing how to rig the election.Read More: How Artificial Intelligence Will Forever Change How We LiveNot every election this year will amount to a meaningful change in government or policy, nor will they necessarily lead to the fall of democracy outright. But collectively, their results will help shape an increasingly precarious world— particularly amid heightened bloc rivalry between the West and China, a rise in right-wing nationalism across Europe, and ongoing armed conflicts between Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine.“These elections can change the world,” says Lindberg, of the V-Dem Institute. No matter their results, he says, it’s likely that after 2024 the world is going to be “a very different place.”Correction, Jan. 10The original version of this story misstated Narendra Modi's title in India.

        "title_text": "Can Targeted Assassinations Win the War for Israel?",
        "body_text": "It was only the timing of the Tuesday drone strike against a Hamas leader in Beirut that came as a surprise. Saleh al-Aruri had been on Israel’s hit list for years, as a member of Hamas’s inner circle and commander of its activities in the occupied West Bank.But why did Israel—although it has chosen not to take responsibility publicly—kill Aruri now? Could targeted assassinations be an alternative to the all-out war that Israel has been waging in Gaza? As a response to the shock suffered by Israel on October 7, when Hamas smashed through the border from Gaza and killed 1,200 people, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government have vowed to destroy the Palestinian Islamic radicals who have ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. The Hamas-controlled health ministry claims more than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes, and whatever the precise number—or the true number of Hamas fighters versus innocent civilians—the Gaza war has become a bloody affair condemned by most countries around the world. While the United States continues to arm Israel, the Biden Administration has declared that too many civilians are dying. In repeated visits to Israel by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, America is reportedly trying to guide Israel toward more surgical and less widely lethal ways of shrinking Hamas.Are targeted assassinations the answer? Tuesday’s successful attack in Lebanon’s capital eliminated a top Hamas man, blamed for terrorist attacks for decades, and lately directing the growing Hamas violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The U.S. offered $5 million for information leading to Aruri’s capture, after three Israeli teens—one, a U.S. passport holder—were murdered in 2014. That kidnaping led to a brief Israel-Gaza war. Men who cause that kind of trouble are men that the Mossad likes to eliminate.Yet we have found, in studying Israeli tactics for half a century, that assassinations are not a strategy for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mossad veterans admit that targeted killings are merely a tactic: to derail plans by terrorists, to disrupt the leadership of various factions  (including the late Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization), and to demonstrate that Mossad’s long arm can reach Israel’s enemies anywhere on Earth.Targeted killings are a supplement to Israel’s powerful military strength. President Joe Biden might wish that Hamas, with its strong-willed ideology that rejects the existence of a Jewish state, could be defeated through surgical strikes with very little collateral damage. But after the atrocities of October 7, an unprecedentedly implacable response by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was inevitable.Read More: Biden Must Push NetanyahuThe targeted strikes will continue, whenever Israel’s intelligence agencies—anxious to restore their credibility and reputation for excellence and effectiveness—can locate Hamas leaders. But Netanyahu and the IDF believe that won’t be enough. They are intent on finding and destroying tunnels and underground facilities thought to span hundreds of miles. And somehow, the Israelis hope to accomplish that while rescuing the surviving hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7. The IDF believes there are around 136, although officers privately say they don’t know how many might still be alive.While Israel refuses to acknowledge or deny it carried out Tuesday’s assassination, the country’s officials are not concealing their glee. With precision, the drone and its missiles killed Aruri and several other extremists. That would be the most recent example of close coordination among the Mossad, the domestic security agency Shin Bet, and the air force. Eliminating such a senior Hamas man would almost certainly require a go-ahead by Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has ordered politicians not to talk about the strike.Aruri was not suspected of planning or executing the October 7 assault by Hamas terrorists. Yet he was seen with the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, on that very day in Qatar, praying on their knees to celebrate the attack. Aruri’s death is seen as a part—though only a small part—of Israel’s revenge for October 7.The explosive death of Aruri in Beirut sheds new light on Israel’s doctrine of assassination, which was first used—in Gaza—against an Egyptian colonel in 1955. Dozens of senior personnel in Palestinian armed movements have been killed, in operations coordinated by the Mossad, in at least a dozen countries.Officials of the spy agency have told us, for decades, that assassinations are a measure of last resort. Israeli intelligence would prefer to capture and interrogate terrorists, and sometimes it has managed to “turn” Palestinian radicals into paid or blackmailed informants for Israel. But to prevent future attacks that the target is believed to be planning, and occasionally as revenge for prior acts, assassinations have been a method of choice.“It was always a calculated, rational, well thought-out decision,” former Mossad director Zvi Zamir told us. Zamir, who died on January 1 at age 98, personally witnessed the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by Palestinian terrorists. As spy chief, he planned and executed Israel’s response: a series of assassinations in Italy, France, Lebanon, and elsewhere.Read More: Inside the Israel-Hamas Information War“I didn’t think about revenge,” Zamir said, explaining that his goal was to disrupt Palestine Liberation Organization networks in Europe and elsewhere. As evidence that Israel was not blindly vengeful, Zamir told us about three of the terrorists who took part in the Olympics massacre— captured by West Germany but later released in a deal with the PLO. The Mossad never pursued them, and two of them died of natural causes. The third, he told us, was still alive and probably living in Saudi Arabia.In contrast—with Israel enraged by the October 7 mass murders, rapes, mutilations, and kidnappings—the current head of the Mossad, David (Dedi) Barnea, has pledged to “hunt down anyone who was involved.” Officials ranging from the Israel Defense Forces spokesman to Prime Minister Netanyahu have publicly vowed to kill top Hamas leaders hiding in Gaza. And the head of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, went further by declaring, “We will assassinate the top Hamas people in Qatar and Turkey.”Israeli officials have prepared a poster, showing photos and names of senior Hamas men—and have marked each picture with a large “X” when that person is killed in Gaza. Some Israelis printed a deck of playing cards, similar to what U.S. forces in Iraq did while hunting for Saddam Hussein in 2003, with each card representing a man targeted for elimination.The meaning of all this is clear: Israel is now driven by revenge, in order to heal its own trauma and boost the morale of its people after the disastrous security failures of October 7.While Mossad veterans insist that assassinations are only a rare tactic, the spy agency has killed selected Palestinians in Europe, Lebanon, and Syria. Shin Bet did that for many years in the Gaza Strip and still does it in the West Bank, in tandem with army commandos.Yet after half a century, it is demonstrable that targeted killings are not the answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Every person who is shot or blown up—even if he’s very senior, or in the Israeli parlance, “the head of the snake”—has been replaced.In 1995, Mossad’s ultra-secretive hit team, known as Kidon (Hebrew for “bayonet”) killed Fathi Shiqaqi—founder of Palestinian Islamic Jihad—in the island nation of Malta. But PIJ has only become larger and more dangerous, frequently launching rockets and other attacks at Israel from Gaza.Two years later, Kidon assassins went to Jordan—despite that Arab country being a strategic partner of Israel—and poisoned a Hamas operative named Khaled Meshaal. Some of the Israelis were captured, however, and King Hussein agreed to release them only when the Mossad provided an antidote. All Israel accomplished was turning Meshaal into a Palestinian hero, who then rose to Hamas’s top echelon. The botched operation in Jordan led to an inquiry commission, which forced Mossad director Danny Yatom and some subordinates to resign. One of them became mentally unstable and caused internal alarm by threatening to kill his comrades.There was a notable success in 2008, in a rare joint assassination mission by the Mossad and the CIA. In Damascus, Syria, they blew up Imad Mughniyeh, the military chief of Hezbollah who was extremely close to Iran’s regime. That was probably Israel’s most important targeted killing, but Hezbollah is still very much alive and kicking.Intelligence and military chiefs in Israel are struggling to devise a strategy that includes assassinations without depending on them. They are not a strategy for overall victory, but they are a tactical step which solves some problems in the short term. If only to restore deterrence after October’s disaster—in a simple sense, to frighten Israel’s enemies—it’s likely that Israel will maintain and add to its “bank of targets,” the name that officials use for their hit list.

        "title_text": "Oscar Pistorius Freed on Parole After Serving 9 Years for Girlfriend’s Murder",
        "body_text": "(PRETORIA, South Africa) — Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius was released from prison on parole early Friday morning and was believed to be at his uncle’s mansion after authorities secretly moved the world-famous double-amputee athlete who killed his girlfriend at an undisclosed time to avoid the glare of news crews waiting outside the jail.South Africa's Department of Corrections announced in a two-sentence statement at around 8:30 a.m. that Pistorius had been released and was “now at home.” It gave no more details other than to confirm Pistorius' new status as “a parolee.”Pistorius, 37, served nearly nine years of his murder sentence of 13 years and five months for the fatal shooting of model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day 2013. He became eligible for early release from prison having served at least half his sentence and was approved for parole in November.Department of Corrections spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo told The Associated Press that Pistorius was processed according to procedure: taken from the Atteridgeville Correctional Center prison in the South African capital, Pretoria, to a parole office before being released to his family. Nxumalo declined to say what time Pistorius was released and where he was.“I can only tell you he was released this morning,” Nxumalo said.Pistorius was expected to initially live at his uncle’s home in an upscale Pretoria suburb after his release. A police van was outside that house and a police officer was seen coming out later Friday. The officer declined to comment to reporters. Three black private security vehicles were also parked in front of the mansion.The Department of Corrections said ahead of Pistorius’ release that it would not publicize his parole time and he was not going to be “paraded” so as to keep him away from the media that has trailed him since he shot Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet door at his Pretoria villa more than a decade ago.Pistorius will live under strict parole conditions until the remainder of his murder sentence expires in December 2029.Steenkamp’s mother, June Steenkamp, said in a statement that she had accepted Pistorius’ parole as part of South African law.“Has there been justice for Reeva? Has Oscar served enough time? There can never be justice if your loved one is never coming back, and no amount of time served will bring Reeva back,” June Steenkamp said. “We who remain behind are the ones serving a life sentence.”“With the release of Oscar Pistorius on parole, my only desire is that I will be allowed to live my last years in peace with my focus remaining on the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation, to continue Reeva’s legacy.”The Department of Corrections has emphasized that the champion Paralympic sprinter's release — like every other offender on parole — does not mean that he has served his time.Some of Pistorius’ parole conditions include restrictions on when he’s allowed to leave his home, a ban on consuming alcohol, and orders that he must attend programs on anger management and on violence against women. He must also perform community service.Pistorius will also have to regularly meet with parole officials and will be subjected to unannounced visits by authorities. He is not allowed to leave the Waterkloof district without permission and is banned from speaking to the media until the end of his sentence. He could be sent back to jail if he is in breach of any of his parole conditions.South Africa does not use tags or bracelets on paroled offenders so Pistorius will not wear any monitoring device, Department of Corrections officials said. But he will be constantly monitored by a department official and will have to inform the official of any major changes in his life, such as if he wants to get a job or move to another house.Pistorius has maintained that he shot 29-year-old Steenkamp by mistake. He testified that he believed Steenkamp was a dangerous intruder hiding in his bathroom and shot four times through the door with his licensed 9 mm pistol in self-defense.Prosecutors said he killed his girlfriend intentionally during a late-night argument.Steenkamp’s family did not oppose his parole application in November, although June Steenkamp said in a victim statement submitted to the parole board then that she didn’t believe Pistorius had been fully rehabilitated and was still lying about the killing.Before the killing, Pistorius was seen as an inspiring role model after having had both of his legs amputated below the knee as a baby because of a congenital condition. He became a champion sprinter on his carbon-fiber running blades and made history by competing at the 2012 London Olympics.His murder trial destroyed his image. He was accused of being prone to angry outbursts and acting recklessly with guns, while witnesses testified about various altercations he had with others, including an argument in which he allegedly threatened to break a man’s legs.Pistorius was first convicted of culpable homicide — a charge comparable to manslaughter — and sentenced to five years in prison for killing Steenkamp. After appeals by prosecutors, he was ultimately found guilty of murder and had his sentence increased, although that judgment by the Supreme Court of Appeal still didn’t definitively rule that he knew it was Steenkamp behind the bathroom door.Pistorius was first sent to prison in 2014, released on house arrest in 2015 during an appeal, and then sent back to prison in 2016. He was initially incarcerated at the maximum security Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Pretoria but was moved to Atteridgeville early in his sentence because it's better suited to holding disabled prisoners.Reaction to Pistorius’ parole has been muted in South Africa, a stark contrast to the first days and months after Steenkamp’s killing, which sparked angry protests outside of Pistorius’ court hearings calling for him to receive a long prison sentence. There is no death penalty in South Africa.“He has ticked all the necessary boxes,” said Themba Masango, secretary general of Not In My Name International, a group that campaigns against violence against women. “And we can only wish and hope Oscar Pistorius will come out a better human being.”“We tend to forget that there is a possibility where somebody can be rehabilitated.”___Imray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.",

        "title_text": "Only U.S.-Led Intervention Can Bring Peace to the Middle East",
        "body_text": "The current humanitarian and political disaster unfolding in Israel and the Palestinian territories requires immediate international intervention. This intervention will not succeed unless it also aims to break the endless cycle of violence and ensuring long-term regional stability. After decades of conflict, it is clear the parties are unable to reach a resolution without help. The Oslo Peace Process initiated in 1993 is definitively over. What is required now is a new paradigm, one which will resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and ensure stability in the Middle East once and for all.As the U.S. leads a multilateral combat force into the Red Sea to protect international shipping lanes, I propose instead that it should act decisively to resolve the growing regional conflict at its root, instead of deepening its involvement in the quagmire of that conflict’s symptoms. To do so, the U.S. should lead a multilateral peace-keeping force, with regional Arab and international allies, to physically intervene in Gaza and the West Bank and end hostilities within a political framework which will resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. While this may sound far-fetched, it is the only realistic solution to a long-standing and intractable problem, and it would be in U.S. interests. The need for an immediate ceasefire is clear, as is the urgent and dire need for international humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in Gaza, whatever the political context. However, a humanitarian force in Gaza would not be able to achieve even limited goals operating under Israeli auspices, as it will be perceived as enforcing Israeli occupation, and will face resistance by the Palestinians. So any international intervention will need a broader legal framework in which to operate, and is bound to be involved in security aspects as well as humanitarian ones.With this in mind, the intervention can and should have the aim of both dealing with the immediate humanitarian crisis and of resolving the conflict once and for all. In order to do so, it must be (1) U.S.-led, inclusive of regional and international allies; (2) based on a clear international legal framework and political outcome; (3) strictly limited in time, e.g., 3 years; (4) impartial, with the aim of protecting both Israeli and Palestinian civilians across the occupied territories while (5) organizing the delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance and aid in Gaza, the return of hostages and initiating the process of reconstruction and (6) the context for organizing elections leading to a final peace agreement. Read More: Biden Must Push Netanyahu Having the multilateral force be U.S.-led will achieve three objectives: 1. It will make the intervention more palatable to Israel enhancing its chances of success; 2. It will rehabilitate the U.S. in the Arab and Islamic world, and counteract a growing perception of it as an enemy, one which is funding and arming a military occupation force committing war crimes; and 3. It will protect U.S. interests both in terms of supporting Israel’s security and at a regional and international level.The U.S. has always been Israel’s strongest ally. This intervention should be viewed as exercising that support to its fullest, by decisively implementing a realistic, long-term strategy to ensure Israel’s security, instead of short-term reactionism that perpetuates the outbursts of violence.  Only the U.S. has the leverage and relationships to convince Israel of this. A decisive physical intervention would also be strongly in the U.S. interest: leading this multilateral, multinational force would firmly demonstrate the U.S.’s global leadership, especially in democracy and human rights. It would put the U.S. on the right side of international “values and morals”, thereby increasing its soft power. It would prevent Russia and China from expanding their influence in the Middle East. It would support Middle Eastern allies.  And it would achieve the elusive goal of peace in the Middle East and a safe and secure future for Israel within it. Amid criticism of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and accusations of softening support for Ukraine, this strategic move would also reaffirm the U.S. commitment to take concrete action to support both its allies and the world’s most vulnerable, with minimal risk to U.S. personnel. In fact, it would reduce risk to U.S. personnel regionally by helping to defuse terrorist threats. The participation of regional Arab allies in the multilateral force is also crucial to the effectiveness and legitimacy of the initiative. It will build trust with Palestinians and Israelis, and help stabilize the participating countries as well, by showing decisive action to end the war, provide aid and assistance and protect civilians. Psychologically, the impact of their involvement cannot be overstated: it will be the end of Israel’s isolation. Coupled with the end of the occupation which it heralds, the intervention itself will be the harbinger of peace.The legal framework and defined outcome are necessary for two reasons. First, in order to avoid a repeat of the Oslo process. While it is too early now to define the details of the final agreement, the framework provided by the Arab Peace Initiative—a widely-accepted, U.N.-based formula for regional peace and the full acceptance of Israel in return for ending the occupation of Palestinian territories and the return of refugees—should be sufficient to ensure an equitable agreement is reached between Israelis and Palestinians. It will also encourage the participation of regional Arab allies in the process, which will be to the benefit of all parties. The clear legal backdrop will also play an essential role in building hope and support among the populations on both sides for the process itself and for the peaceful outcome at its end. It will provide a context to develop a national electoral process for the Palestinians at the end of the first year, and the framework for the national debates that need to take place within and amongst Israelis and Palestinians themselves. It is, of course, impossible to guarantee the outcome of a democratic process—but there is no other option. While Hamas, or an affiliated political party, may well—and should be permitted to—run in these elections, they will have little to offer to voters. I believe people are more likely to choose a guaranteed equitable peace over continued conflict. Also, poll results over the past years indicate that Palestinians are still more likely to vote for a secular and free state, instead of a religious one with all its restrictions. Most analysts view the Hamas majority achieved in the 2006 elections as principally a rejection of an endless and hopeless peace process and a corrupt leadership. A new Palestinian leadership would also be free of the odor of corruption and incompetence that undermines the Palestinian Authority today.The three-year timeline will guarantee a clear end point: an agreement must be reached by then, at which point the multilateral forces can leave. The end point is important for Israelis and Palestinians, a definite horizon after which life can begin to be normal. It is also important for the countries participating in the multilateral force, who will thereby be committing to a strictly time-limited operation.  The intervention must also operate impartially to protect civilians across all of the occupied territories, and not only in Gaza. Although Israel portrays its current attack on Gaza as a war against Hamas, from the Palestinian and broader regional perspective this is the latest iteration of a war against the Palestinian people (and Arab peoples) which never ended. Palestinians in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) are also subjected to daily violence by extremist settlers and the Israeli army, which needs to be stopped. Guaranteeing the human security of civilians across the occupied territories will also ensure the acceptance and positive reception of the multilateral force by local populations. As it minimizes friction between, e.g., settlers and villagers in the West Bank, and protects Israeli civilians from potential terrorist attacks, the multilateral force will also create a sense of calm and safety. It will increase the sense of security of the Israelis. It will defuse tensions, and organically engender the development of pro-peace sentiment. This will build a legitimate, popular basis for the peace accords and positive momentum on which to build into the future.There will most likely be resistance to this proposal by groups on both sides. That does not make it any less necessary or urgent. Indeed, the main argument supporting this intervention is that the two sides are unable to make peace without it. There will most likely also be extremists who reject the idea of peace, and splinter groups who will do their utmost to derail this process (as there were in Northern Ireland, when the Provisional IRA rejected the peace agreements). They cannot be allowed to undermine the future of the majority of the peoples on both sides.The current Israeli government may reject an international intervention as a violation of Israeli sovereignty. However, that sovereignty does not extend to the occupied territories, where the multilateral force will operate. Israel may also argue that it refuses to hand off the responsibility for its security to a multilateral force, claiming it can only rely on itself.  But Israel’s massive security failures of October 7 already undermines that assertion. Moreover, Israel already relies on others for its security. It essentially subcontracts its security in the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority, and it has often noted the success and importance of that relationship in keeping Israel safe (and indeed, that with other regional partners such as Jordan and Egypt). And, as has been made painfully clear in its current war on Gaza, without bottomless U.S. backing, Israel needs outside arms and ammunition to defend itself.  It is also clear that Israel’s entire security paradigm needs to shift. It is not sufficient for it to rely on walls, fences, technology, or military superiority, again as evidenced by the attacks of October 7. What Israel needs is the long-term security that comes from peace with the Palestinians and regional acceptance in the Middle East; and not only by its governments, but also by its peoples. Moreover, Israel is far from the only country whose security is at stake, and it must not have the only say.  The security of the region as a whole, and of U.S. and other interests there, must also be taken into account.  The populations of Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and elsewhere—not only in Yemen —are seething in anger and solidarity with Palestinians. This regional instability is already endangering friendly governments, Israel itself, and U.S. interests and forces in the area. Moreover, Israel has already announced it is in a long-term multi-front war: it has recently likely assassinated a senior Iranian general in Syria, and is threatening to attack Lebanon. No other Middle East “peace” plan or option under discussion—e.g., without the overarching political framework, or without regional allies, or focusing purely on Gaza—has the required legitimacy to succeed. Although this U.S.-led multilateral peace-keeping force involves committing U.S. troops and funds to yet another operation in the Middle East, which many will find difficult to accept, this action is crucial for a long-term strategic victory for the U.S. across the region. It is better and safer to commit to U.S. troops to this, than to commit further troops to fighting in the Red Sea and beyond. It will be cheaper for the U.S. taxpayer than providing continuous funding and military support to an Israel at war for the foreseeable future. It will bring peace and security to Israelis and Palestinians, the regional integration and acceptance of both Israel and the U.S., and all the positive political and economic dividends that follow.",

        "title_text": "What to Know About Bangladesh’s Election",
        "body_text": "Last October, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the country’s main opposition party, took to the streets in the city of Dhaka to demand that incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appoint a neutral caretaker government to ensure a free and fair vote in the next general elections. Instead, the 76-year-old leader from the Awami League Party responded by cracking down on her opponents in a deadly clash that saw the arrest of tens of thousands of people, including several senior BNP leaders and their supporters. With Bangladesh now set to head to the polls on Sunday, Jan. 7, some 1,900 candidates from 29 parties will be vying for 300 parliamentary seats. But the BNP has announced that it will be boycotting the election, claiming intimidation, voter suppression, and vote-rigging tactics by the ruling party. Read More: Sheikh Hasina and the Future of Democracy in BangladeshHasina’s legacy has largely been shaped by Bangladesh’s unexpected economic success, growing into a powerhouse with an annual GDP growth that has exceeded neighboring India and Pakistan. Hasina has also skilfully cultivated—and balanced—ties with powerful countries like India and China to receive funding for a slew of infrastructure projects, including Dhaka’s metro and a $2.9 billion bridge across the Ganges river.However, Bangladesh’s economic success may now be under threat. Post-pandemic, the country has been hit with rising inflation and an escalated cost of living. Foreign debt has also doubled since 2016, while foreign exchange reserves have drastically dropped to $20 billion from $48 billion in August 2021. At the same time, the government has taken increasingly authoritarian measures to stifle dissent and curtail civil liberties through systematic arrests and disappearances of critics. “The weaponization of the judicial system to attack journalists, human rights defenders, and civil society leaders diminishes the independence of the judiciary and erodes fundamental human rights,” stated a group of UN special rapporteurs in November.In the absence of opposition—and with the Awami League reportedly nominating and endorsing the majority of the remaining contestants whom the BNP calls “dummy candidates”—Hasina is all but guaranteed to secure a fourth consecutive term. But her tenure as the country’s longest-serving leader is marred by the allegations of an increasingly authoritarian rule that critics say will create a de facto one-party state in the South Asian democracy.  “The ruling party is using all the state machinery not only to ensure a victory in the election, but also to decimate the opposition,” says Ali Riaz, a Distinguished Professor at Illinois State University who studies Bangladeshi politics. “An election without choice is not an election.”In the face of a decimated opposition movement at home, the main challenger to Hasina and the Awami League resides nearly 5,000 miles away in London. Tarique Rahman, the son and heir apparent of Khaleda Zia, a former prime minister of Bangladesh and Hasina’s bitter rival, has been living in exile with his wife and daughter since 2008, when he first left Bangladesh for medical treatment. Last August, Dhaka’s court sentenced Rahman to nine years in prison over corruption charges in a 2007 case filed by Hasina’s government. BNP supporters say that the verdict is politically motivated to keep Rahman from politics—if he returns to Bangladesh, he will most certainly be arrested and imprisoned. With Zia under house arrest and suffering from deteriorating health conditions, 55-year-old Rahman now commands the operations of the BNP as acting party chairman, orchestrating anti-government protests at home and abroad and, most recently, the boycott of the elections. “The main challenge for the BNP is that the ruling party is controlling all the state machinery, whether it’s the law enforcement agencies or the judiciary,” Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the BNP’s Secretary-General, told TIME in an interview last year. “So whenever we raise our voices, they oppress us, they arrest us, they make false claims and fake cases,” he continued. Read More: A Make-or-Break Year for Democracy WorldwideHasina’s government flatly denies perpetrating electoral and human rights abuses, but Alamgir is no stranger to this tactic. Last October, the veteran politician, who served as a minister in Zia’s government from 2001 to 2006, was overseeing the BNP headquarters in Dhaka and helping organize mass rallies when he was arrested by authorities for the 10th time. He remains in jail.Many BNP party members say the election outcome will make little difference when the process is skewed. “Millions of people are facing false and fabricated cases every day, and many of them will not be able to participate because they're already convicted,” Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, a BNP standing committee member, previously told TIME. “They will be kept out of the electoral process basically through one way or another.” “We're not talking about election day when the election is stolen way before,” he added.  The BNP’s election boycott will likely lead to a low voter turnout on Sunday, handing an easy win to Hasina and the Awami League. But experts say that what happens after election day is arguably more important, with an increased risk of political upheaval if disgruntled citizens take to the streets. Crucially, the government will need to work with the opposition to de-escalate tensions. “Without a post-election compromise between the parties, Bangladesh’s political crisis is likely to grow,” says Steve Cima, the Regional Director for South Asia at the International Republican Institute.A new nationwide poll conducted by IRI’s Center for Insights in Survey Research found that most Bangladeshis approve of Hasina’s performance on a range of issues. But for the first time since 2014, a majority of Bangladeshis believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. With the Awami League’s parliamentary majority inflated, the ruling party will need to work harder to demonstrate that it will respond to the needs of all Bangladesh’s citizens, Cima adds. Riaz, the professor at Illinois State University, adds that how Western nations react to the election outcome will also impact Bangladesh’s descent into authoritarianism—with global ramifications. “The policy of ‘business-as-usual’ will have an impact beyond Bangladesh,” he says. “The absence of a robust reaction will allow China to have a larger footprint in Bangladesh and elsewhere.”",

        "title_text": "How Experts Believe Starvation Is Being Utilized in Gaza",
        "body_text": "Last month, Reham Shaheen’s four-year-old daughter cried all day from hunger, finally falling asleep while waiting for her only meal of the day to finish cooking. Shaheen has been stuck in Jordan since the Israel-Hamas war began, separated from her home, husband and three children who are in Gaza. “I spent two days not able to eat at all, thinking of my daughter, that she couldn’t find food,” Shaheen told TIME in a voice note Friday. Shaheen says her family receives flour from the U.N., but it isn’t enough to feed 24 people sharing one tent in Rafah, southern Gaza. They struggle to find canned food or get goods in the market, where prices have skyrocketed ten times and they must wait in long lines to receive small amounts, she says. Children and adults are coming to hospitals with serious malnutrition, and at the first hint of any infection, they lose weight rapidly, Professor Nick Maynard, a senior surgeon from Oxford University Hospital and the clinical lead of an emergency medical team said in a statement.“The reality on the ground here is much, much worse” than what Maynard realized from afar, he told TIME in a voice message from Gaza on Friday as drones whined in the background. Read More: Gaza Is Being Made UnlivableInternational agencies have repeatedly sounded the alarm that Gaza is starving. The U.N. has said that one in four people are starving and nine out of ten families in some areas spend a day and night without food. A December report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification predicted that by February, all 2 million people in Gaza would face crisis levels of acute food insecurity, with at least one in four households facing famine-like conditions. After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Oct. 9 ordered “a complete siege on the Gaza Strip,” saying “there will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.” Then-Energy Minister Israel Katz said on Oct. 16 he opposed the opening of the blockade, while National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Oct. 17 that no aid should enter Gaza as long as Hamas held hostages.  Israel began allowing aid in on Oct. 21 for the first time since the war started, but some human rights groups and legal experts have pointed to these statements and Israel’s actions that led to a hunger crisis as evidence that starvation is being used as a weapon of war in Gaza. International law that governs armed conflicts states that “intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including willfully impeding relief supplies” is a violation. Catriona Murdoch, a partner at Global Rights Compliance and legal expert who’s studied starvation in wars in Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and Ukraine tells TIME that when it comes to Israeli rhetoric, “it is really flagrant the way in which they are very clearly publicizing their intent.” In response to TIME’s question about these accusations, Col. Elad Goren, the head of the civil department of COGAT, the Israeli agency that facilitates aid in Gaza, said in a virtual press briefing Friday that the “narrative of blockade—that is completely false.” Goren says Israel is supplying 28 million liters (7.4 million gallons) of water daily to Gaza, has let in 126,000 tons of aid since the war started and increased the number of trucks carrying food from around 70 a day before the war to 109 daily this week. \"According to our assessment, which is based on our conversations with the U.N. and other humanitarian agencies, there is a sufficient amount of food in Gaza and we continue to push the humanitarian agencies to collect more trucks at the borders and to distribute them. However, we hear voices calling for additional aid to be brought into Gaza,” Goren said in his opening remarks. “Israel has not and will not stand in the way of providing humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza that are not a part of terror. They are not our enemy.” Read More: Gazans Have Nowhere Left to FleeBut Juliette Touma, Director of Communications at the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), tells TIME that the number of trucks, including commercial goods, going into Gaza has dropped from around 500 every working day since the war began, and there is not enough aid. The U.N. said that in the last week of December, food assistance only reached 8% of targeted people in need. Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, tells TIME in an email Friday that “owing to Israeli restrictions, the level of life-saving humanitarian assistance entering the Gaza strip is minimal and is far below the survival needs of the civilian population.” Goren said Israel was willing to increase aid as much as the U.N. can receive it, and the U.N. and others need to increase capacity with more trucks, workers and longer working hours as well as improving packing and implementing a QR system to track deliveries. UNRWA has pushed back on Israel’s statements that its agency is responsible for gaps in aid, and Secretary-General António Guterres said in December the real problem was “the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles.” The U.N. said it hasn’t been able to deliver food to north Gaza this week because of “delays and denials,” along with active combat. The U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs tells TIME in an email Friday that aid continues to be hindered by security risks and mobility constraints, including multiple inspections, long lines at checkpoints and damaged roads. “Inside Gaza, aid operations face constant bombardments, with aid workers themselves killed and some convoys having been shot at,” the office says. Touma tells TIME that IDF soldiers shot at an aid convoy traveling south between Gaza City and Nuseirat area on Dec. 28. In response to the report, Goren says Friday: “This is a war zone and we are facilitating access and movement by a lot of humanitarian organizations. If there is some claim, we will take all the information, investigate and we'll give the answer to this agency.” U.N. officials say a humanitarian ceasefire and the safe and unrestricted flow of supplies into Gaza, including commercial goods, are vital to avert famine. Israel should facilitate the entry and delivery of commensurate aid, Laurence says, adding that “failure to act in line with these obligations may have serious consequences under international law.” Some legal experts and advocates argue laws are already being violated. Human Rights Watch drew from Israeli officials’ statements, interviews with people in the territory about the lack of food and evidence of bombardment that has destroyed infrastructure and resources to accuse Israel in a December report of starvation as a war crime.Starvation and sieges as a means or result of war are not uncommon. Other examples include in Biafra, Nigeria, Sarajevo, Bosnia, Syria and in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. However, Alex De Waal, Executive Director at the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, said in a recent article that the pace and scale of the destruction of objects indispensable to survival in Gaza “surpasses any other case of man-made famine in the last 75 years.”  De Waal tells TIME that since there are warnings leading up to starvation, “if you don't adjust your behavior according to that feedback, then you become responsible, because you are acting in the knowledge that this is the outcome.” Read More: What Palestinian Children Face in Israeli PrisonsAbout Israel’s actions in Gaza, he says “the fact that they are continuing to mount this offensive … even when they know the outcome, that is recklessness, a second-degree crime, which qualifies as a crime against humanity in the legal arguments of most of the scholars.” Murdoch also says circumstantial evidence is sufficient to prove starvation as a war crime—if information exists that if a course of conduct is continued, it will lead to civilians starving, then those in charge can be held responsible. Starvation as a war crime has never been prosecuted, she says, but her organization has produced a report arguing it is happening in South Sudan and she wants her group to be allowed to conduct an independent investigation in Gaza. The issue could also be addressed on the global stage as the International Court of Justice reviews South’s Africa petition accusing Israel of genocidal intent, which mentions starvation. Israel has rejected the genocide claim and will fight the complaint, starting with a public hearing next week. But the case, which will likely drag on for years, does nothing for Shaheen’s family right now. They are miserable, she says, and her own emotions frozen as she watches their suffering from afar. All she can do, she says, is call upon the warring parties for a “ceasefire now, and save the lives of the innocent civilians.” ",

        "title_text": "U.K. Leader Rishi Sunak Announces New Law to Overturn Convictions in Post Office Scandal",
        "body_text": "U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has proposed a new law that would exonerate victims of the Post Office scandal, in which hundreds of employees were wrongfully accused after faulty software showed discrepancies in the company’s finances. The new legislation has not yet been published and voting timelines are unclear, but Sunak says former Post Office workers who were part of the group litigation in 2019 would be eligible for an upfront payment of £75,000 ($95,000). “This is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history. People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and their reputations destroyed through absolutely no fault of their own. The victims must get justice and compensation,” said Sunak. “Today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.” Sunak’s announcement during the Prime Minister's Questions comes after the Metropolitan Police confirmed they are  investigating potential fraud offenses related to the years-long scandal where the Post Office wrongfully convicted its employees because of faulty software. The saga is at the forefront of the public’s mind once again, following the TV series Mr Bates vs the Post Office airing on U.K. TV. The show, and the attention surrounding it, has brought forward new potential victims.The Met Police had already been looking into potential offenses of perjury and perverting the course of justice related to prosecutions and investigations carried out by the Post Office. The force opened an investigation in January 2020 into matters concerning Fujitsu Horizon, the name of the company and its software, and the Post Office following a referral from the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Met Police tells TIME in an email. The potential offenses come from investigations and prosecutions carried out by the Post Office, for example money recovered from sub-postmasters as a result of the office’s prosecutions or civil actions, the law enforcement agency says. Two people have been interviewed in the investigation as of Saturday, police say. TIME reached out to the Post Office for comment. The Criminal Cases Review Commission has called the scandal the “most widespread miscarriage of justice the CCRC has ever seen and represents the biggest single series of wrongful convictions in British legal history.”The ongoing fall-out resulted in former Post Office boss Paula Vennells returning her CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) on Jan. 9. Vennells received the royal title in 2019, the same year she stepped down from her role. Following the premiere of the TV series based on the scandal, more than 700,000 people signed an online petition to strip Vennells of her CBE—compared to 1,000 signers before the TV show aired, Sky News reported.\"I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system,” Vennells said in a statement shared by PA News Agency. She handed back the CBE honor on Tuesday with immediate effect.Here’s what you need to know. Japanese tech company Fujitsu Services developed and began operating the Horizon IT financial software services for the Post Office in 1999. Employees said they reported issues with the software from the start, but claimed the Post Office brushed off their concerns or said the issues were the fault of the individual branch managers. CCRC, which reviewed the wrongful convictions, said that “Horizon appeared to have significant bugs which could cause the system to misreport, sometimes involving substantial sums of money which sub-postmasters found difficult to challenge as they were unable to access information about the software to do so.” As a result, between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 sub-postmasters were accused of wrongdoing, leading to prosecutions, criminal convictions and, in some cases, prison sentences, the BBC reported. Postmasters found guilty were ordered to pay the Post Office for the money they were accused of stealing, leading in some cases to bankruptcy and financial ruin. Victims and their families have reported that wrongful convictions contributed to addiction, illness and suicides. Computer Weekly first reported issues with the Horizon software that caused it to incorrectly state the amount of cash on the premises of a post office in 2009, the same year aggrieved employees formed the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance Group to fight for justice. In 2016, sub-postmasters initiated civil proceedings against the Post Office, which more than 500 employees eventually joined. The group won its case in the High Court in 2019 and the Post Office agreed to pay damages. To date, 93 convictions have been overturned, per the BBC.As of December, the government has paid out £124.7 million ($158.6 million) in compensation to wrongfully convicted postmasters. The number of individuals with overturned convictions who have received full and final compensation is 25, according to the Post Office. In September, the government announced it was raising its compensation to £600,000 ($763,500) for every victim. Offers have been made to all 2,417 current or former postmasters under the Horizon Shortfall Scheme. In an interview on BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg on Jan. 7, ahead of his announcement of a new proposed law, Sunak said “it’s important that those people get the justice that they deserve, and that’s what the compensation schemes are about.” The TV show, starring Toby Jones as former sub-postmaster Alan Bates, who led the campaign for justice at the High Court, aired from Jan. 1 to Jan. 4. Following the premiere of the mini-series, 50 new potential victims have come forward, Neil Hudgell, a lawyer on behalf of claimants, told the BBC. Post Office Chief Executive Nick Read said in a statement on the agency’s website that he hoped the TV show “encourages anyone affected who has not yet come forward to seek the redress and compensation they deserve.”The series, aired on U.K. channel ITV, has grown public sympathy for victims as well as demands for accountability.  In an interview with the BBC, Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who says the Post Office ruined his life, shared that he is “really, really angry” over the ongoing situation.    Speaking about the impact of the ITV drama, Castleton said he hoped “that pressure comes to bear. That’s what we’ve tried to do for years. It's been very difficult to try to push our cause.” “We’re just people from your village shop or your local post office,” he continued. “And it's been really hard to drum up support, it's been very difficult to get people to believe.” He said he hoped those listening would put pressure on those in power to help their cause.Nobody from the Post Office or Fujitsu had been held accountable as of last year. The Post Office still retains a role in the appeals process for the prosecutions it brought forward, the BBC reported. In Sunday’s interview, BBC journalist and show host Laura Kuenssberg asked Sunak if Justice Secretary Alex Chalk would look at removing the Post Office from that role or exonerating everyone convicted.“Obviously, there's legal complexity in all of those things but he is looking at exactly those areas that you've described,” Sunak responded. “It is right that we find every which way we can do to try to make this right for the people who were so wrongfully treated at the time.” In 2019, the High Court ruled that the original Horizon system had encountered a number of bugs and errors. When handing down his judgment, Mr. Justice Fraser shared that he would be expressing his “grave concerns” over the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The DPP forwarded Mr. Justice Fraser’s letter to the police, who are responsible for investigating potential crimes.An official inquiry into the scandal has been ongoing since 2020, led by retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams. The Met Police tells TIME their investigation is “considering the actions of individuals connected with Fujitsu and the Post Office” and that they are an “interested party to the public inquiry and are monitoring and gathering the evidence it hears.” After the High Court ruling, the Post Office’s then-CEO Paula Vennells said in a statement that she was \"truly sorry for the suffering caused.” Since the scandal, the government extended its contract for Horizon with Fujitsu.",

        "body_text": "WAJIMA, Japan — A woman in her 90s was pulled alive from a collapsed house in western Japan late Saturday, 124 hours after a major quake slammed the region, killing at least 126 people, toppling buildings and setting off landslides.The woman in Suzu city, Ishikawa Prefecture, had survived for more than five days after the 7.6 magnitude quake that hit the area Monday. Nationally broadcast news footage showed helmeted rescue workers covering the view of the area with blue plastic, and the woman was not visible.Chances for survival diminish after the first 72 hours. Several other dramatic rescues have been reported over the past few days as soldiers, firefighters and others joined a widespread effort.Among the 126 dead was a 5-year-old boy who had been recovering from injuries he suffered when boiling water spilled on him during Monday’s 7.6 magnitude earthquake. His condition suddenly worsened and he died Friday, according to Ishikawa prefecture, the hardest-hit region.Aftershocks threatened to bury more homes and block roads crucial for relief shipments. Officials warned that roads already cracked could collapse completely. That risk was growing with rain and snow expected overnight and Sunday.Wajima city has recorded the highest number of deaths with 69, followed by Suzu with 38. More than 500 people were injured, at least 27 of them seriously.The temblors left roofs sitting haplessly on roads and everything beneath them crushed flat. Roads were warped like rubber. A fire turned a neighborhood in Wajima to ashes.More than 200 people were still unaccounted-for, although the number has fluctuated. Eleven people were reported trapped under two homes that collapsed in Anamizu.For Shiro Kokuda, 76, the house in Wajima where he grew up was spared but a nearby temple went up in flames and he was still looking for his friends at evacuation centers.“It’s been really tough,” he said.Japan is one of the fastest-aging societies in the world. The population in Ishikawa and nearby areas has dwindled over the years. A fragile economy centered on crafts and tourism is now more imperiled than ever.In an unusual gesture from nearby North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un sent a message of condolence to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the official Korean Central News Agency reported Saturday.Japan received messages earlier expressing sympathy and promises of aid from United States President Joe Biden and other allies.Japanese government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that Japan was grateful for all the messages, including the one from North Korea. Hayashi said the last time Japan received a condolence message from North Korea for a disaster was in 1995.Along Japan’s coastline, power was gradually being restored, but water supplies were still short. Emergency water systems were also damaged.Thousands of troops were flying and trucking in water, food and medicine to the more than 30,000 people who had evacuated to auditoriums, schools and other facilities.The nationally circulated Yomiuri newspaper reported that its aerial study had located more than 100 landslides in the area, some blocking lifeline roads. Some communities remained isolated and waiting for aid.“I hope the city recovers, and I hope people won’t leave, and they stay here to work hard toward recovery,” said Seizo Shinbo, a seafood trader, who was stocking up on noodles, canned goods and rice balls at a supermarket.“There is no food. There is no water. And the worst is gas. People are still in kilometer-long lines,\" Shinbo said.",

        "title_text": "Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Extends Rule After Overwhelming Victory in Election Opposition Deemed Unfair",
        "body_text": "DHAKA — Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has won an overwhelming majority in Bangladesh’s parliamentary election after a campaign fraught with violence and a boycott from the main opposition party, giving her and her Awami League a fourth consecutive term.While the Election Commission has been slow to announce the results of Sunday’s election, TV stations with networks of journalists across the country reported that the Awami League won 216 seats out of 299. Independent candidates took 52, while the Jatiya Party, the third largest in the country, took 11 seats. The results for the rest of the constituencies were still coming in late on Sunday night.The election was held in 299 out of 300 parliamentary seats. In one seat, the election was postponed as required by law after an independent candidate died.A final official declaration from the Election Commission is expected on Monday.Read More: The Ultimate Election Year: All the Elections Around the World in 2024At least 18 arson attacks preceded the vote but the election day passed in relative calm. Turnout was around 40%, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal said after the polls closed.The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former premier Khaleda Zia refused to accept the election outcome, saying Bangladeshi voters have rejected the government’s one-sided election.Security incidents, including four deaths in an arson attack on a passenger train on Friday, intensified tensions ahead of the election that was shunned by Zia’s party and its allied groups. They accuse Hasina of turning Bangladesh into a one-party state and muzzling dissent and civil society.Authorities blamed much of the violence on the BNP, accusing it of seeking to sabotage the election. On Saturday, detectives arrested seven men belonging to the BNP and its youth wing for their alleged involvement in the train attack. The party denied any role in the incident.On Sunday, a supporter of an Awami League candidate was stabbed to death in Munshiganj district near the capital, Dhaka, officials said. Police did not comment immediately.A victory for the 76-year-old Hasina, the country’s longest-serving leader and one of its most consequential, would come with a deeply contentious political landscape.Read More: Sheikh Hasina and the Future of Democracy in BangladeshThe vote, like previous elections, has been defined by the bitter rivalry between Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP, led by Zia, who is ailing and under house arrest on corruption charges, which her supporters claim are politically motivated.The two women ran the country alternately for many years, cementing a feud that has since polarized Bangladesh’s politics and fueled violence around elections. This year’s vote raised questions over its credibility when there are no major challengers to take on the incumbent.Badshah Mia, a rickshaw puller in Dhaka, said he wouldn’t vote given the limited choices, adding that the atmosphere didn’t exude that of “a fair election.”Sakibul Hasan Chowdhury, a businessman, felt the same. “There is no opposition and no candidate of my choice. So how would I benefit from voting?”A small business owner, Habibur Rahman, said he was voting for the ruling party candidate in his constituency but added that there didn’t seem to be much of a turnout.Critics and rights groups say the vote follows a troubling pattern, where the past two elections held under Hasina were sullied by allegations of vote-rigging — which authorities have denied — and another boycott by opposition parties.The government has rejected a monthslong demand by the BNP to have a neutral caretaker government administer Sunday’s vote.The government has defended the election, saying 27 parties and 404 independent candidates are participating. But with scores of candidates from the Awami League running as independents and mostly smaller opposition parties in the race, analysts say Hasina’s win is near inevitable.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, said none of those contesting would be able to mount much of a challenge to Hasina’s party. “The outcome is all but guaranteed, and that is that the Awami League will return (to power) again,” he said, noting that “Bangladesh’s democracy will be in an extremely precarious state once the election is done.”Read More: A Make-or-Break Year for Democracy WorldwideThe vote has also been called into question by accusations of a sweeping crackdown against the BNP. The party says about 20,000 of its members were jailed ahead of the vote on trumped-up charges. The government disputed the figures and denied that arrests were made due to political leanings, saying the numbers of those arrested were between 2,000-3,000. The country’s law minister in an interview with BBC said 10,000 were likely arrested.Abdul Moyeen Khan, a former minister and BNP leader, said the spate of arrests forced him and scores of other party members to go into hiding for weeks until candidacy nominations were halted. “It was the only way we could ensure our safety and carry on raising our voice (against the government)” he said.“We are not boycotting an election — what we are boycotting is a fake and one-sided election that this government is carrying out,” Khan added.Hasina is credited with transforming the economy of a young nation born out of war and making its garment sector one of the world’s most competitive. Her supporters say she has staved off military coups and neutralized the threat of Islamic militancy. And internationally, she’s helped raise Bangladesh’s profile as a nation capable of doing business and maintaining diplomatic ties with countries often at odds with each other, like India and China.Yet her critics say her rise has risked turning Bangladesh into becoming a one-party state where democracy is under threat, as emboldened government agencies increasingly use oppressive tools to mute critics, shrink press freedoms and restrict civil society.Read More: 5 Takeaways from TIME’s Interview with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh HasinaThe global economic slowdown is also being felt in Bangladesh, exposing cracks in its economy that have triggered labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.After casting her ballot, Hasina dismissed concerns over the legitimacy of the vote, telling reporters she was accountable to the people and whether they accepted the election or not was what mattered to her.“I’m trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country,” she added. “Without democracy, you cannot make any development.”—Associated Press video journalist Al-Emrun Garjon contributed to this report.",

        "title_text": "China Claims It Caught a Foreign Consultant Spying for the U.K.’s MI6",
        "body_text": "China has detained the head of an overseas consulting firm for allegedly spying on the Asian nation for the British government, putting renewed focus on an industry targeted by Beijing’s national security crackdown.China’s spy agency said Monday that the U.K.’s MI6 intelligence service employed the consultant from a “third country” to carry out espionage activities. The alleged spy, surnamed Huang, provided the U.K. with state secrets and intelligence, according to the Ministry of State Security’s official WeChat account.The MSS’s statement didn’t identify any firms or Huang’s nationality. The British embassy in Beijing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Read More: China’s Expanded Anti-Espionage Law Threatens Business Consultants and AdvisersThe investigation underscores Beijing’s continued scrutiny on the consulting sector, which over the past year has been subject to an anti-espionage crackdown and frequently accused by the MSS of leaking classified information. Turmoil in a sector employed by money managers to navigate Chinese markets has fueled concern among some investors that President Xi Jinping’s fixation on security will hamper his push to attract foreign capital and revive economic growth.The Chinese agency said MI6 approached Huang in 2015 for intelligence cooperation, directing the consultant to travel to China multiple times, collect intelligence and identify potential assets. The U.K. spying agency trained and equipped the person to carry out espionage, the MSS said.This is the first time the MSS alleged British spying on its WeChat account since it began posting in August. The ministry has previously provided details on alleged spies for U.S. authorities.Security officials visited and searched expert-research company Capvision’s office in Shanghai in May, accusing the company of abetting espionage efforts by foreign entities. The Chinese authorities in August fined U.S. due diligence firm Mintz Group for illegal data collection, months after officials raided its offices in Beijing and detained five of its Chinese employees. In April, American consultancy Bain & Co. said Chinese authorities had questioned staff at its Shanghai office. Beijing has ratcheted up efforts to crack down on spying and adopted a new counter-espionage law that came into effect last year. That legislation expands the list of activities that could be considered spying, intensifying the risks for foreign firms. China’s powerful spy agency is usually secretive about its work but has taken on a more public profile recently, including launching a comic series adapted from real-life espionage cases on Sunday.The MSS said it has arranged for consular visits after enforcing criminal measures on Huang.

        "title_text": "Judges in England and Wales Given Cautious Approval to Use AI in Writing Legal Opinions",
        "body_text": "(LONDON) — England’s 1,000-year-old legal system — still steeped in traditions that include wearing wigs and robes — has taken a cautious step into the future by giving judges permission to use artificial intelligence to help produce rulings.The Courts and Tribunals Judiciary last month said AI could help write opinions but stressed it shouldn’t be used for research or legal analyses because the technology can fabricate information and provide misleading, inaccurate and biased information.“Judges do not need to shun the careful use of AI,” said Master of the Rolls Geoffrey Vos, the second-highest ranking judge in England and Wales. “But they must ensure that they protect confidence and take full personal responsibility for everything they produce.”At a time when scholars and legal experts are pondering a future when AI could replace lawyers, help select jurors or even decide cases, the approach spelled out Dec. 11 by the judiciary is restrained. But for a profession slow to embrace technological change, it's a proactive step as government and industry — and society in general — react to a rapidly advancing technology alternately portrayed as a panacea and a menace.“There’s a vigorous public debate right now about whether and how to regulate artificial intelligence,” said Ryan Abbott, a law professor at the University of Surrey and author of “The Reasonable Robot: Artificial Intelligence and the Law.”“AI and the judiciary is something people are uniquely concerned about, and it’s somewhere where we are particularly cautious about keeping humans in the loop,” he said. “So I do think AI may be slower disrupting judicial activity than it is in other areas and we’ll proceed more cautiously there.”Abbott and other legal experts applauded the judiciary for addressing the latest iterations of AI and said the guidance would be widely viewed by courts and jurists around the world who are eager to use AI or anxious about what it might bring.In taking what was described as an initial step, England and Wales moved toward the forefront of courts addressing AI, though it's not the first such guidance.Five years ago, the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice of the Council of Europe issued an ethical charter on the use of AI in court systems. While that document is not up to date with the latest technology, it did address core principles such as accountability and risk mitigation that judges should abide by, said Giulia Gentile, a lecturer at Essex Law School who studies the use of AI in legal and justice systems.Although U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts addressed the pros and cons of artificial intelligence in his annual report, the federal court system in America has not yet established guidance on AI, and state and county courts are too fragmented for a universal approach. But individual courts and judges at the federal and local levels have set their own rules, said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.“It is certainly one of the first, if not the first, published set of AI-related guidelines in the English language that applies broadly and is directed to judges and their staffs,” Coglianese said of the guidance for England and Wales. “I suspect that many, many judges have internally cautioned their staffs about how existing policies of confidentiality and use of the internet apply to the public-facing portals that offer ChatGPT and other such services.”The guidance shows the courts’ acceptance of the technology, but not a full embrace, Gentile said. She was critical of a section that said judges don't have to disclose their use of the technology and questioned why there was no accountability mechanism.“I think that this is certainly a useful document, but it will be very interesting to see how this could be enforced,” Gentile said. “There is no specific indication of how this document would work in practice. Who will oversee compliance with this document? What are the sanctions? Or maybe there are no sanctions. If there are no sanctions, then what can we do about this?”In its effort to maintain the court's integrity while moving forward, the guidance is rife with warnings about the limitations of the technology and possible problems if a user is unaware of how it works.At the top of the list is an admonition about chatbots, such as ChatGPT, the conversational tool that exploded into public view last year and has generated the most buzz over the technology because of its ability to swiftly compose everything from term papers to songs to marketing materials.The pitfalls of the technology in court are already infamous after two New York lawyers relied on ChatGPT to write a legal brief that quoted fictional cases. The two were fined by an angry judge who called the work they had signed off on “legal gibberish.”Because chatbots have the ability to remember questions they are asked and retain other information they are provided, judges in England and Wales were told not to disclose anything private or confidential.“Do not enter any information into a public AI chatbot that is not already in the public domain,” the guidance said. “Any information that you input into a public AI chatbot should be seen as being published to all the world.”Other warnings include being aware that much of the legal material that AI systems have been trained on comes from the internet and is often based largely on U.S. law.But jurists who have large caseloads and routinely write decisions dozens — even hundreds — of pages long can use AI as a secondary tool, particularly when writing background material or summarizing information they already know, the courts said.In addition to using the technology for emails or presentations, judges were told they could use it to quickly locate material they are familiar with but don't have within reach. But it shouldn’t be used for finding new information that can't independently be verified, and it is not yet capable of providing convincing analysis or reasoning, the courts said.Appeals Court Justice Colin Birss recently praised how ChatGPT helped him write a paragraph in a ruling in an area of law he knew well.“I asked ChatGPT can you give me a summary of this area of law, and it gave me a paragraph,” he told The Law Society. “I know what the answer is because I was about to write a paragraph that said that, but it did it for me and I put it in my judgment. It’s there and it’s jolly useful.”",

        "title_text": "Why Netanyahu Can’t Talk About Post-War Gaza",
        "body_text": "When Israel launched its war in Gaza in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 massacre, in which some 1,200 people were killed by Palestinian militants, it did so with one stated goal: the total elimination of Hamas. Three months on, that goal remains elusive, shrouded by the killing of more than 22,000 Palestinians (the vast majority of them civilians, according to the Israeli military’s own estimates), the displacement of nearly 2 million people within the Strip, and a level of destruction not seen since World War II.What has been just as elusive is Israel’s plan for the so-called “day after” the war ends in Gaza. While the Biden administration has articulated some of its own hopes for the future of the enclave (including bringing Gaza under the control of a newly “revitalized” Palestinian Authority, the governing body that currently administers certain parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted laying out his own blueprint. An Israeli official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told TIME that there has been “no decision made” on an official day-after plan, noting that any such agreement would be subject to a vote by the cabinet.In that void, some senior far-right Israeli politicians have advanced their own ideas, among them the Israeli resettlement of the Strip (reversing the country’s 2005 withdrawal of its security forces and settlements from Gaza) and the mass deportation of the enclave’s more than 2 million inhabitants to Egypt and elsewhere—a violation of international law that has been roundly rejected by the U.S. as well as neighboring Arab states. One lawmaker from Netanyahu’s ruling Likud Party even went so far as to amplify calls for all Gazans to be “destroyed.”That Netanyahu hasn’t dismissed these extreme calls nor been seen to publicly endorse alternative proposals put forward by relatively more moderate voices largely comes down to his own political vulnerability. Since returning to power in late 2022 following a brief stint in opposition, Netanyahu has had to balance his own political imperatives (chiefly, avoiding conviction in his ongoing corruption trial) with that of his far-right coalition partners, whose aims include imposing a more theocratic society and further cementing Israeli control—and, ultimately, annexation—of the occupied West Bank. Since Oct. 7, that task has become all the more difficult, forcing Netanyahu to answer both to his far-right allies and to his political rivals in the emergency war cabinet that was formed in order to see the country through the war.That vulnerability has been compounded by Netanyahu’s own dwindling popularity. Indeed, most Israelis fault the prime minister for failing to prevent the Oct. 7 attack, according to an October poll. Just 15% believe he should remain in office once the war ends. “He’s constantly worried about pandering to his right-wing base and to shoring up [his position in the] polls, because polls all show that Israelis don’t want him there—they don’t want him there now, and they don’t want him there later,” says Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group. “He’s at the worst popularity level he’s ever been.”As a result, Netanyahu has avoided expressing any kind of vision for the “day after,” opting instead only to reveal what he would not accept. This includes not allowing the Palestinian Authority to have any role in the future governance of Gaza (a position that isn’t supported by the U.S. and other regional partners) nor consenting to the creation of an international force to oversee security along the Israel-Gaza border. He has also reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state, which both President Biden and Arab leaders have said must be the ultimate goal. It is no coincidence that these are all positions shared by Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of whom represent the most extreme elements of Israeli society. While neither are involved in the war cabinet, keeping them happy is critical to Netanyahu’s own political survival. “If one of them jumps ship,” says Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum and a former senior advisor to ex-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, “the coalition disintegrates.”Read More: Biden Must Push NetanyahuInsofar as Netanyahu has stated any preferred outcome in Gaza, it’s to prevent Hamas from ever reemerging as a threat to Israel again—an outcome he says would require Israel maintaining a tight security grip over the Strip indefinitely. “Once we defeat Hamas, we have to make sure that there’s no new Hamas, no resurgence of terrorism,” he told NPR in November. “And right now the only force that is able to secure that is Israel.” But whether Israel can eliminate Hamas in its entirety remains to be seen. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby appeared to walk back expectations last week, telling reporters: “Are you going to eliminate the ideology? No. And are you likely going to erase the group from existence? Probably not. But can you eliminate the threat that Hamas poses to the Israeli people? Absolutely.”While U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to the region this week is expected to address Israel’s post-war plans, some experts warn that the prospects of achieving any kind of agreement at this stage of the war remains slim. “You really need to move beyond this conceit of the ‘day after,’” says Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator, noting that the post-war reconstruction and rehabilitation of Gaza will likely be measured in years.That Netanyahu has conflated his own political survival with what he considers to be in the best interest of Israel makes such agreements even more unlikely, Miller adds. “How far you could actually get in terms of implementing a more rational post-conflict environment in Gaza with the current government in Israel? Not very far.”It’s perhaps for this reason that U.S. officials are reportedly thinking beyond the Netanyahu era under the expectation that the longtime Israeli prime minister’s days in power are numbered. While an Israeli election in 2024 is certainly possible, particularly if public pressure in favor of one begins to mount, it seems unlikely any time soon. “For Israelis right now, it’s very hard to transition to [elections] when you’re still in such deep war mode,” Zonszein says. “But that’s what they want … I mean, something’s got to give one way or another this year.” In the meantime, “The uncertainty and the insecurity continues,” she adds. “I don’t think anything that Israel has achieved in the last three months has made Israelis feel safer.”",

        "title_text": "The Resurgence of Global Anti-Americanism",
        "body_text": "If you look at the graph of American favorability around the world since World War II, there are two deep chasms: the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the election of Donald Trump thirteen years later.They are related: each moment suggests an America of testosterone and bluster, of xenophobia and nativism, of my way or the highway.Both are 21st century versions of the Ugly American stereotype from the 1950s.Between 2017 and 2020, during the Trump Administration, U.S. favorability declined in each major region of the world, most deeply among our key security and trade partners. We went from favorability in the 70s, to the 20s and 30s.Under Joe Biden, the U.S. built back much of its international credibility from the highs of the Obama years—we have a median favorability rating of 62%—and in some regions, our favorability is approaching Obama levels. Now, with America’s support for Israel in the Israel-Hamas war, those old anti-American feelings are flooding back around the world.At a campaign event in December, President Biden suggested that America and Israel were losing global support around the world. A few days later, by a margin of 153 states in favor, and only 10 against (one of them being the U.S.), the U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for a ceasefire in Gaza.We’re in for a long season of global anti-Americanism.                                             *                      *                      *Concern about America’s image around the world is in our DNA as a nation.  In 1630, John Winthrop famously said America would be seen as “a city on a hill” in a sermon he gave on the ship Arabella making its way to the Massachusetts Bay Colony—before he’d even set foot in America.The next sentence was, “The eyes of all people are upon us.”The opening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence asserts that America’s historic separation from England must be explained out of “a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.”The Founders cared a lot about the opinions of mankind, a word that appears three times in the Declaration. They thought about fame, their image, and how they presented themselves to the world. From the beginning, America was both a revolutionary new world and a model for the old one.  From the beginning, we’ve also been more than a little narcissistic, believing that “the eyes of the world are upon us.”Read More: Inside the Israel-Hamas Information WarEvery country has some version of this, but in the U.S.’s case, it’s more true than anywhere else.America’s reputation abroad has varied over two-and-a-half centuries. We evolved from an upstart revolutionary nation who fired “the shot heard ‘round the world,” an audacious underdog, to become a global hyper-power.  We went from that city on a hill to a nation that fought a continent-wide civil war over slavery, to the nation that, during World War I, made the world “safe for democracy,” in Woodrow Wilson’s phrase.That idea reverberated. As the late Henry Kissinger said, every American president since Wilson has had to be in the democracy-promotion business and and something of a foreign policy idealist.In WWII we were the “arsenal of democracy,” as FDR put it. (A term that Joe Biden alluded to recently in his Oval Office speech on Israel.)But during the Cold War, we were often seen as brutish and heavy-handed. The Ugly American on steroids. Siding with authoritarian governments as long as they were anti-Communist.  Choosing security over democracy. Not living up to our own ideals.With the fall of the Soviet Union, the U.S. became the lone superpower, and the “Washington Consensus” reigned—democratic free market capitalism was the way to prosperity and security.We squandered a lot of that goodwill with the invasion of Iraq after 9/11.We’re seeing an echo of that today in the global disapproval of America’s steadfast support for Israel.                                             *                      *                      *I was President Obama’s Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.So, what is Public Diplomacy? It should be an easy question to answer, but it isn’t. If you ask 10 diplomats, you’ll get 10 different definitions.The best definition in my opinion is what Harvard professor Joe Nye called “soft power.”It’s not guns and butter, but music and movies, culture and ideas.My job was to worry about and help shape America’s image abroad.   After a few months at State, I had a town hall and a senior diplomat asked me who did I think was America’s most effective public diplomat.I said that it was a difficult question to answer because I thought it was hard to choose between Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.I wasn’t trying to be funny. Most of the time, in term of influence, culture eats policy for breakfast.Except times like the present.When policy, especially unpopular policy, has a disproportionate impact—the invasion of Iraq, the Trump “Muslim ban,” U.S. support for Israel— it undercuts the power of American culture.For example, after the invasion of Iraq, there was a statistically significant decline of Coca-Cola sales in a number of countries and protests directed at the American soft drink manufacturer. In a Pew survey at the time, the study noted the popularity of American culture globally, “yet in general the spread of U.S. ideas and customs is disliked by majorities in almost every country.”Now, there are Arab boycotts of American companies and social media is filled with pictures of empty McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Domino Pizzas across the Middle East.                                                         *                      *                      *Brand America shifted during the Obama administration.  And it wasn’t just because Barack Obama was the first Black president and an extraordinarily popular figure on the world stage.  With the rise of the internet and social media—all pioneered by American companies—America mutated from the nation of missiles and McDonalds to that of the World Wide Web and integrated circuits. We became a beacon of innovation—the technological city on a hill.When I was at the State Department, foreign officials didn’t ask me to set up meetings at the White House, they pleaded for introductions to Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft.Read More: Why Netanyahu Can't Talk About Post-War Gaza The election of Donald Trump changed much of that. Within a year, the U.S. had lower favorability around the world than we had even during the invasion of Iraq. It was not only the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, the “s---hole countries,” the disdain for NATO and our traditional alliances—we took a tremendous hit during COVID: the country that invented the iPhone could not manufacture enough cotton swabs.Between 2017 and 2020, U.S. favorability plummeted in every major region of the world, most deeply among our principal security and trade partners. France and Germany featured the greatest declines. We sunk from favorability in the 70s, to the 20s and 30s. The numbers looked similar in our closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico.In the U.K., at the end of Trump’s term, his favorability was one point below Putin’s, 18% to Putin’s 19%.Those numbers have rebounded around the world under Biden. But it’s not quite the same. Biden said “America was back,” and our allies welcomed that, but asked: For how long?It’s a fair question.Social media not only shows good things about U.S. culture, it shows Jan 6th and government shutdowns. January 6 is an indelible global image of the decline of American-style republican government. We are no longer the model of democracy we once were.The attack on the Capitol has become a global symbol of America, like a negative-Statue of Liberty. What was the reaction around the world? Horror, yes, sadness, even pity, but also schadenfreude, the pleasure in the discomfort of someone else.You told us what to do and now look at yourselves.To the Chinese and the Russians, it was their dream come true.An image of democratic dysfunction—the ripping off of the façade of comity and efficiency to reveal the chaotic impulses underneath.It confirmed everything they had been saying about the instability of democracy.Our shining city on a hill looked like Blade Runner.In 2023, U.S. favorability is up: Whereas a median of just 34% across 12 nations had a favorable overall opinion of the U.S. last year, a median of 62% now hold this view.Most of our allies see America as a reliable partner but no longer as a model for democracy. Only 17%, according to the Pew Survey, say the U.S. is a good example for other countries to follow. That used to be 57%.Still, it’s relative. China lags well behind us. A median of 67% across 24 countries have an unfavorable view of China, according to Pew.And as for Russia, well, they have an 82% unfavorable rating.Now the war in the Middle East is upending the return of American favorability.Around the world, Israel, despite the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of Oct. 7, is seen as the muscle-bound oppressor of Palestinian human rights, and the U.S. is seen as Israel’s accomplice and enabler.Read More: How to Find Common Ground Between Israelis and PalestiniansTo much of the world, Israel is the bully and we’re the bully’s protector.Netanyahu’s strategy (and that of the Trump administration) that Israel could normalize relations with the Sunni nations of the Middle East while marginalizing the Palestinians has blown up. Those Sunni partners will not come back to the table until there is something like a two-state solution.As one anonymous cable from the U.S. embassy in Oman put it, “We are losing badly on the messaging battlespace,” adding that America is “losing Arab publics for a generation.”                                                         *                      *                      *There’s an existential struggle going on around the world between the Western rules-based order and the Chinese/Russian might-makes-right world.China and Russia believe in what was known in the 19th century as sphere-of-influence diplomacy. That is, a world where powerful countries can do what they want in their sphere of influence. The Monroe Doctrine anyone?Authoritarians like the sphere-of-influence world.  And we are living in a time of democratic decline: According to Freedom House, the number of democratic countries in the world has declined every year for the last fifteen.We are moving from a rule of law world to a law of rulers world.To Putin, it’s simple: Ukraine is in Russia’s sphere of influence and they can do whatever they want with it.China’s ambition is even greater: they see the entire planet as part of their sphere-of-influence.The Chinese argument is that democracy is not the most efficient and effective way of bringing prosperity and security to a nation. They have a lot of evidence of that. In the last 40 years, China has brought more people into the middle class than in the history of civilization. The rate of upward social income mobility in the U.S. has declined substantially for the last half century.And talk about public diplomacy. The Chinese have spent more than a $1 trillion dollars on their Belt and Road Initiative to build infrastructure around the world. That dwarfs the Marshall Plan even in real terms.On a trip to Africa when I was at State, I had a meeting with an African foreign minister and at the end he said to me, “You come to see me and talk about transparency and human rights. The Chinese come and build me a super highway. Who do you think I’m going to listen to?”China's message is, We will help you get rich and we won’t bother you about democracy or human rights.                                             *                      *                      *This existential struggle goes has its roots in America’s founding. America’s social contract was that liberty and self-determination was a more powerful engine of human freedom than vassalage and the divine right of kings. It’s a competition between two kinds of social contracts. The Russian and Chinese social contract is, We offer you security and perhaps prosperity, but not freedom. You give up your freedom in exchange for stability. They see democracies as offering freedom without security, which brings on decadence, corruption, and January 6th.It is the Enlightenment against 21st century feudalism.We believe that democratic self-government and individual rights are the best way to secure prosperity and happiness.But we are living in a global democratic recession.  The recent election of a self-described anarcho-capitalist in Argentina and a far-right anti-immigrant extremist in Holland are only the two latest examples.                                              *                      *                      *This struggle between democracy and authoritarianism is not only going on between countries. It’s going on within countries.We see that domestically every day.We have a significant minority of the country that seems to want an authoritarian leader who has spoken disparagingly of the Constitution and democracy. Recent polls show an appetite for an American “strongman.”There is widespread support for “democracy”—but there is significantly less support for democratic norms.Our 250-year-old social contract is that We the People are able to govern themselves, and that freedom brings prosperity and security.But our frequent protestations that democracy is fragile and that freedom, as Ronald Reagan said, is always one generation away from extinction is not very appealing to people around the world. Yes, we agree, say the Chinese.Our own model seems broken. We are the least majoritarian democracy in the world. Try explaining the electoral college to a foreigner. We tell people voting matters, and in our country not every vote counts.And the Russians continue to try to make sure that is true.                                              *                      *                      *American exceptionalism is a bit of a taboo phrase these days.During his first presidential campaign, Barack Obama got in some hot water when he said that every nation thinks its exceptional. But I think that is true.We are different in part because of how we were created as a nation. Unlike most nations around the world, America is not based on a common blood or a common religion or a common background.We are based on a set of uncommon ideas—that all people are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.We believe those are not American ideas but universal ideas—that they are human rights.Those are old ideas that are still a challenge to achieve.Nations sometimes need to make hard choices. Sometimes our loyalty to our allies and support for freedom and self-determination are in conflict.We have often chosen security over human rights in our foreign policy.To much of the world, the argument we’ve made in favor of Ukrainian sovereignty and human rights suggests support for the Palestinians, not the Israelis.  We must always try to align our values with our policy, and that’s not always easy.In the next few years, we will be perceived more as the nation of brawn and bombs than ingenuity and innovation. Our hard power choices are overriding our soft power advantage.With indispensability comes responsibility, and sometimes responsibility forces you to make choices that are not popular. We’re seeing that now.This article is adapted from a speech to the Virginia Civil Rights Law Institute. ",

        "body_text": "Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdouh, who lost his wife, 7-year-old daughter, and 15-year-old son in an Israeli airstrike in October, lost another child to an Israeli airstrike over the weekend. Al-Dahdouh’s 27-year-old son, al-Dahdouh, who was also a journalist at Al Jazeera, was killed Sunday while in a car returning from an assignment along with another colleague, Mustafa Thuraya. Hazem Rajab, a freelancer who was with the duo, was also wounded. The IDF confirmed it had targeted the vehicle, saying that “an IDF aircraft identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops,” in a statement. They added that they are “aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit”.This is the fourth immediate family member that Wael al-Dahdouh has lost, not including his grandchild and eight other relatives who were also killed in the October airstrike. Read More: Al Jazeera Journalist Whose Family Was Killed in Airstrike Is Wounded in Gaza. Another Has DiedDespite the pain of losing his family, al-Dahdouh told an NBC News crew in Gaza that he will not stop reporting. “It is true that the pain of losing someone is very difficult and when it is about your eldest son after the death of the family, then it becomes even more difficult,” he said. “In the end, this does not change anything of reality, and will not change any of our decisions. We are going to proceed as long as we are alive and breathing. As long as we are able to do this duty and deliver this message.”Since the war began, at least 79 journalists have been killed–72 were Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese, making this the deadliest time period for media workers since the Committee to Protect Journalists began tracking journalist deaths in 1992. There has been growing concern from both the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders that journalists are being targeted by the Israeli military. “The killings of journalists Hamza Al Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuraya must be independently investigated, and those behind their deaths must be held accountable. The continuous killings of journalists and their family members by Israeli army fire must end: journalists are civilians, not targets,” said the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator Sherif Mansour in a statement on Sunday. There are approximately 1,000 journalists working in Gaza, according to the International Federation of Journalists. Approximately one in every 200 people has been killed in Gaza, but among journalists, approximately fourteen out of every 200 people has been killed.Reporters Without Borders has secured the inclusion of crimes against journalists as part of the International Criminal Court’s investigation into the ongoing situation in Palestine. \"Crimes against journalists are being examined by the prosecutor's office, among other potential crimes, as part of the ongoing investigation into the situation in Palestine, and RSF's objectives and actions must be supported and are of crucial importance in Gaza and elsewhere,” the office of the ICC prosecutor said in a statement. “Journalists are protected by international humanitarian law and the Rome Statute and must not under any circumstances be targeted in the exercise of their important mission.\"The Israeli military says that it does not deliberately target journalists. “Every journalist that dies it’s unfortunate,\" said IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari in an interview with NBC regarding the killing of Hamza Al Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuraya.“We understand they were using a drone. And using a drone in a war zone, it’s a problem. It looks like the terrorists,” Hagari said, saying that Hamas uses drones in order to get intelligence on Israeli forces. Al Jazeera’s managing editor Mohamed Moawad told NBC News that the two reporters were not flying a drone while they were in their car returning from their assignment. ",

        "title_text": "Pope Francis Calls Surrogate Motherhood ‘Deplorable,’ Calls for Global Ban",
        "body_text": "Pope Francis on Monday called for a global ban on what he called the “deplorable” practice of parenting via surrogacy, a stance that is likely to roil the LGBT community, of which many members have relied on the practice to have their own children.In his annual foreign policy address to diplomatic envoys accredited at the Holy See, the Pope mentioned “surrogate motherhood” in his list of threats to global peace and human dignity—which also included the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the climate crisis, and challenges around migration and asylum.Read More: The Vatican Softens Its Rules for Catholics on Keeping Ashes of the Dead“I deem deplorable the practice of so-called surrogate motherhood, which represents a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child, based on the exploitation of situations of the mother’s material needs,” he said. “A child is always a gift and never the basis of a commercial contract.”Francis, 87, said the life of the unborn child “cannot be suppressed or turned into an object of trafficking,” and he said he hoped for “an effort by the international community to prohibit this practice universally.”It’s not the first time Francis has voiced the Catholic Church’s opposition to surrogacy, though the Vatican’s doctrinal office had previously said that children born out of homosexual parents’ surrogacy could be baptized, as long as there was “a well-founded hope that [the child] will be educated in the Catholic religion.”In the same speech on Monday, Francis also reiterated his condemnation of “gender theory” that challenges the binary categories of male and female, which he described as “extremely dangerous since it cancels differences in its claim to make everyone equal.”Francis has been touted by some for ushering in a more progressive Catholic Church, especially when it comes to accepting the LGBT community–just weeks ago, he approved priests to bless same-sex couples. But he has maintained conservative positions in other areas, such as abortion. Read More: What Pope Francis’ Statement About Possible Blessings for Same-Sex Couples Could MeanData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the number of embryo transfer cycles that used gestational carriers (commonly known as surrogates or surrogate mothers) has been on the rise, from 2,841 in 2011 to 9,195 in 2019, followed by a slight decrease in 2020—when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.But ethical concerns over the commercial nature of surrogate childbirth has led several countries, such as Spain, Italy, and Taiwan, to ban the practice altogether. Some countries only allow altruistic surrogacy, which means a woman may carry an embryo that is not hers so long as it is done without monetary compensation. In the U.S., laws vary state by state.Critics of surrogacy have also warned against a poverty bias, arguing that women who are more financially desperate often cater to the desires of the wealthy, at the expense of their body.",

        "title_text": "South Korea’s Parliament Unanimously Passes Historic Dog Meat Ban",
        "body_text": "After decades of deliberation spanning multiple administrations, South Korea’s parliament on Tuesday unanimously passed a special bill to outlaw the dog meat industry—a move welcomed by animal rights advocates both domestic and worldwide.The ban, which was passed on Tuesday with 208 votes in favor, none against, and two abstentions, will take effect after a grace period of three years. Starting in 2027, those who breed, butcher, distribute, or sell dog meat for human consumption may be jailed up to three years or fined up to 30 million won ($22,800).“This ban marks a significant turning point in South Korea’s attitude to animal protection,” Sangkyung Lee, a campaign manager at Humane Society International said in a statement on Tuesday. “While dog meat is only eaten by a very small proportion of the population, millions of dogs had to endure unimaginable pain and suffering.”Activists estimate that nearly one million dogs are factory farmed and killed for human consumption in South Korea every year. Government statistics show that there are over 1,000 dog farms and about 1,600 restaurants selling dog meat dishes.Read More: Surge in Unwanted Dogs Fuels ‘Crisis’ Across U.S. Animal SheltersSouth Korea’s dog meat trade has been the subject of heated national debate. While only a small minority of the East Asian nation’s 52-million-person population still partakes in the centuries-old practice of eating dog meat, public backlash fueled by animal cruelty concerns has sharpened over the years.In a survey on the issue conducted in December and published on Monday by a local animal rights group, 93% of respondents said they had no intention of eating dog meat—with no significant difference in responses between those who own pets and those who don’t. The bill still needs South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s final approval, which is all but certain: Yoon and his wife, who own six pet dogs themselves and whose love for animals is widely known, have been outspoken champions of a dog meat ban. Yoon’s ruling People Power Party had previously aimed to introduce a ban by the end of 2023. However, previous proposals were stymied after vehement opposition from dog meat farmers and sellers, who have even scuffled with police during protests and in November threatened to sic their dogs on lawmakers in Seoul.Read More: South Korean Farmers Threaten to Release 2 Million Dogs in Protest of Dog Meat BanAuthorities will now require dog farmers and business owners to submit plans to reduce and eventually close their businesses. The bill passed Tuesday also offers subsidies to support those whose livelihoods will be affected by the ban, to ease their transition out of the dog meat industry. Still, the ban has been met with frustration from dog farmers, who are expected to organize further protests and file an appeal to the constitutional court. “We are overjoyed by this change and thank lawmakers and local activists who have worked tirelessly to see this become a reality despite the dangers and pushback,” Fleur Dawes, the communications director of In Defense of Animals, a U.S.-based animal protection organization, said in a statement. Together with its local partner Jindo Love Rescue, the group rescues dogs from South Korean farms and places them in homes in the U.S. and Canada. “During the phaseout period, we will continue our vital work to save as many innocent lives as we can,” said Dawes.Dog meat, traditionally considered a local delicacy in parts of Asia, has been slowly outlawed in the region, including in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, and some cities in China and Indonesia. South Korea’s latest addition to the list feels like a surreal victory for campaigners in the country. “This is history in the making. I never thought I would see in my lifetime a ban on the cruel dog meat industry in South Korea, but this historic win for animals is testament to the passion and determination of our animal protection movement,” JungAh Chae, the executive director of Humane Society International/Korea, said in a statement. “While my heart breaks for all the millions of dogs for whom this change has come too late, I am overjoyed that South Korea can now close this miserable chapter in our history and embrace a dog friendly future.”",

        "body_text": "A U.S. citizen has been arrested on drug charges in Russia, officials said on Tuesday, amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow over the war in Ukraine. A statement from the Ostankino District Court of Moscow said it ruled to keep Robert Woodland Romanov, who also holds Russian citizenship, in custody for at least two months as he awaits his trial. He has been accused of the \"illegal acquisition, storage, transportation, production, processing of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues,” according to the district court's statement. He faces up to 20 years in prison or an unlimited fine if found guilty. Woodland is the latest U.S. citizen to have been detained in Russia. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg. He has since remained behind bars on espionage charges, which both he and the newspaper strongly deny. The State Department has declared Gershkovich as wrongfully detained. An ex-U.S. marine, Paul Whelan, has also been jailed since 2018 on espionage-related charges that both he and the U.S. government deny. Whelan has been sentenced to 16 years in jail. According to Woodland’s Facebook profile, he teaches English and lives in Dologopruddy, a suburb in northern Moscow. In a Facebook post in September 2022, he voiced his opposition to the war in Ukraine but stated he would serve in the Russian military if he was drafted. “To my friends & family, For those who are worried about my safety out here in Russia with the current situtation and the draft to military service. I'm currently okay. I have not recivied my letter yet. I am not in support of this war, but if my letter to arms comes, I will not turn away. I know this sounds like a stupid choice, but remember.... America had done the same back during the Vietnam War....” he wrote. The U.S. embassy has not yet released a statement on Woodland’s arrest. Some experts have said that that Moscow could be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At least two U.S. citizens—including WNBA star Brittney Griner—have in recent years been exchanged for Russians jailed in the U.S.",

        "body_text": "Emmanuel Macron appointed Gabriel Attal as France’s youngest ever Prime Minister on Tuesday, after previous Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne announced her resignation on Monday.  Attal is also the first openly gay person to hold the job, making his selection a historic first in multiple categories. He has a civil partnership with Stéphane Sejourné, a French Member of the European Parliament. Attal previously served as France’s education minister, where he instituted new performance metrics to measure children’s academic performances and implemented a controversial ban on Abayas in schools. His appointment comes months before the European Parliament elections in June.According to an IPSOS poll that was released in December, Attal is the French politician with the highest approval rating. He has rapidly climbed the ranks of French politics over the past 10 years, starting out as an obscure advisor in the health ministry. “When I appointed [Gabriel Attal] as education minister, I knew he had the necessary energy and courage for the task,” Macron said during a TV interview in December. “I’m proud to have nurtured new talents.”But experts say Attal will grapple with the same challenges as his predecessor. That includes a resurgent right that looks set to make gains in the June European Parliament elections and the lack of a majority in the French parliament that makes enacting Macron's agenda difficult. Macron has also seen his own popularity decrease in the last year and a half, after mass protests erupted over his pension reform plans and members of his own centrist Renaissance party vehemently opposed an immigration bill he hoped to pass. The French President has a 30% approval rating, according to Politico's poll of polls. ",

        "title_text": "China Says It Cracked Apple AirDrop to Identify Message Sources",
        "body_text": "A Chinese state-backed institution has devised a way to identify users who send messages via Apple Inc.’s popular AirDrop feature, Beijing’s government claims, as part of broader efforts to root out undesirable content.The Beijing institute developed the technique to crack an iPhone’s encrypted device log to identify the numbers and emails of senders who share AirDrop content, the city’s judicial bureau said in an online post. Police have identified multiple suspects via that method, the agency said, without disclosing if anyone was arrested. “It improves the efficiency and accuracy of case-solving and prevents the spread of inappropriate remarks as well as potential bad influences,” the bureau said.The declaration again drew attention to an iPhone feature that activists around the world have employed to spread their message. Requiring just a nearby bluetooth connection, it was widely used by protesters to share pro-democracy slogans during 2019 protests in Hong Kong. An Apple representative didn’t respond to requests for comment.Hailed by the article as a “technological breakthrough,” the method could supplement measures intended to eradicate information China deems unhealthy. It also adds more uncertainty to Apple’s operations in a country where it already grapples with severe constraints on content, including on Apple TV and Books.AirDrop allows the quick exchange of files like images, documents or videos between Apple devices. The company has limited the feature on Chinese iPhones since 2022, after the service was used by protesters to spread images to fellow device owners. The American electronics leader also faces mounting sales pressure, after a growing number of state-backed agencies banned the use of foreign devices at work.

        "body_text": "GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) — Masked men broke onto the set of a public television channel in Ecuador waving guns and explosives during a live broadcast Tuesday, and the president issued a decree declaring that the violence-plagued country had entered an “internal armed conflict.”The men armed with pistols and what looked like sticks of dynamite entered the set of the TC Television network in the port city of Guayaquil during a news program that was airing live in thousands of homes across the nation and shouted that they had bombs. Noises similar to gunshots could be heard.No one was killed in the attack, and authorities later said that all the masked intruders had been arrested, 13 in all, and would be charged with terrorism.Authorities have not said who was behind the television station occupation, or a series of other attacks that have shaken the South American country recently, but they follow the apparent escapes from prison of two leaders of Ecuador’s most powerful drug gangs.Read More: Ecuador’s ‘Most Wanted’ Criminal Has Disappeared From PrisonAlina Manrique, the head of news for TC Television, said she was in the control room at TC Television, across from the studio, when the masked men burst into the building. One of them pointed a gun at her head and told her to get on the floor, Manrique said.The incident was aired live, although the station's signal was cut off after about 15 minutes. Manrique said some of the assailants ran from the studio and tried to hide when they realized they were surrounded by police.“I am still in shock” Manrique told The Associated Press in a phone interview. “Everything has collapsed .... All I know is that its time to leave this country and go very far away.”Ecuador has been rocked by a series of attacks, including the abductions of several police officers, in the wake of a notorious gang leader’s apparent weekend escape from prison. President Daniel Noboa on Monday declared a national state of emergency, a measure that lets authorities suspend people’s rights and mobilize the military in places like prisons.Shortly after the gunmen stormed the TV station, Noboa issued another decree designating 20 drug trafficking gangs operating in the country as terrorist groups and authorizing Ecuador's military to “neutralize\" them within the bounds of international humanitarian law. It also said the country had entered an internal armed conflict.Ecuador’s attorney general’s office said the 13 people arrested will be charged with terrorism. It tweeted that it will present the charges in coming hours. Ecuadorian law establishes a penalty of up to 13 years in prison for anyone convicted of terrorism.The government has not said how many attacks have taken place since authorities announced that Los Choneros gang leader Adolfo Macías, alias “Fito,” was discovered missing from his cell in a low security prison Sunday. He was scheduled to be transferred to a maximum security facility that day.On Tuesday, Ecuadorean officials announced that another gang leader, Fabricio Colón Pico of the Los Lobos group, had escaped from a prison in the town of Riobamba. Colón Pico was captured on Friday as part of a kidnapping investigation and has also been accused of trying to murder one of the nation’s lead prosecutors.Other attacks have included an explosion near the house of the president of the National Justice Court and the Monday night kidnappings of four police officers. Police said one officer was abducted in the capital, Quito, and three in Quevedo city.Will Freeman, a political analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that while gangs in Ecuador have previously assassinated a presidential candidate and set off car bombs in front of government buildings, Tuesday's events marked a new peak in violence in the country.“This is a turning point,” Freeman said. “Depending on how the government responds it will set the precedent for these kinds of incidents to continue, or it will use this as a catalyst and make some very necessary structural reforms so that the state can start to win its war against crime.”Located on South America's Pacific coast between Peru and Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producers, Ecuador has become a key transit point for the drug in recent years. Much of the violence suffered by the country comes as drug gangs fight each other and the government for control of ports and smuggling routes.Freeman said that Ecuador's government will have to find ways to control prisons, from where gang leaders continue to lead their operations and might have to consider extraditing some of the top criminal leaders to the United States. The nation of 20 million people might also have to make judicial reforms to give judges greater safety and enable them to anonymously rule over cases involving the drug gangs.“If these guys can storm a TV station or kill a presidential candidate you as a judge will not go up against them unless you really have strong assurances of your safety,” Freeman said.Los Choneros is one of the Ecuadorian gangs that authorities consider responsible for a spike in violence, much of tied to drug trafficking, that reached a new level last year with the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio. The gang has links with Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, according to authorities.The whereabouts of Macías are unknown. Prosecutors opened an investigation and charged two guards in connection with his alleged escape, but neither the police, the corrections system, nor the federal government confirmed whether the prisoner fled the facility or might be hiding in it.In February 2013, he escaped from a maximum security facility but was recaptured weeks later.Noboa said in a message on Instagram that he wouldn’t stop until he “brings back peace to all Ecuadorians,” and that his government had decided to confront crime. The wave of attacks began a few hours after Noboa’s announcement.States of emergency were widely used by Noboa’s predecessor, Guillermo Lasso, as a way to confront the wave of violence that has affected the country.Macías, who was convicted of drug trafficking, murder and organized crime, was serving a 36-year sentence in La Regional prison in the port of Guayaquil.Los Choneros and other similar groups linked to Mexican and Colombian cartels are fighting over drug trafficking routes and control of territory, including from within detention facilities, where more than 450 inmates have died since 2021, according to authorities.—Solano reported from Quito, Ecuador.

        "title_text": "Houthis Launch Barrage of Missiles and Drones in Latest Red Sea Attack",
        "body_text": "Houthi rebels in Yemen carried out one of their largest missile and drone attacks to date on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea late Tuesday, igniting a response from five U.S. and U.K. warships patrolling the region critical to global trade. Eighteen drones, two anti-ship cruise missiles and one anti-ship ballistic missile were shot down by allied forces, U.S. Central Command said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter.A day earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a tour of the Middle East, said there would be “consequences” for the Houthis if they continued to assault ships. It was the latest warning from the U.S. and its allies since the group ramped up attacks in late 2023 and it’s continually said it won’t back down until Israel ends its war with Hamas in Gaza.Read More: How—and Why—Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Poised to Seriously Disrupt the Global EconomyNo injuries or damage to merchant vessels were reported in Tuesday’s “complex” assault, Centcom said. It was the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Nov. 19, according to Centcom, which is responsible for the U.S. military in the Middle East and parts of Asia.The White House is yet to comment on the latest act by the Houthis, an Islamist group from Yemen that touched off a civil war in 2014 with its seizure of the capital, Sanaa.Long trained and funded by Iran, the Houthis have undertaken a series of increasingly brazen attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, ostensibly in support of Hamas against Israel. Still, many of the vessels it’s targeted have tenuous or no links to Israel.Many major shipping companies have re-routed their vessels away from the Red Sea — which links to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal — and sent them on a much longer route around southern Africa. That’s roiled supply chains and pushed up freight costs, potentially filtering through to the global economy and boosting inflation.Over the past weekend, the number of transits through the Suez Canal fell to the lowest since it was blocked by a stuck container ship in 2021, according to Inchcape Shipping Services.While oil prices have been relatively stable, with Brent trading below $80 a barrel, traders are concerned about a prolonged period of attacks.Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war have risen this year, with growing fears that the conflict could expand further across the region.In addition to its operations in Gaza against Hamas, a designated terrorist group by the U.S. and European Union, Israel has traded fire with Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon. In the past week, it’s upped the ante by assassinating Hamas and Hezbollah commanders based in Lebanon.“This is a moment of profound tension in the region,” Blinken said in Sunday in Qatar. “This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering.”The U.S., which assembled a group of nations to help bolster security in the Red Sea, has so far held off on attacks against Houthi targets in Yemen, partly out of concern that would worsen the regional crisis. It is, however, mulling military action, Bloomberg has reported.Saudi Arabia, which borders Yemen and tried for most of the past decade to oust the Houthis from power, is wary that such a move would provoke even more aggressive action from the rebels.Other Gulf states take the same view. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani – speaking alongside Blinken on Sunday – rejected a military response and warned it would only escalate regional tensions.",

        "title_text": "Taiwan Wants Peace and Economic Stability—Now It Could Hinge on a High-Stakes Choice",
        "body_text": "Campaigning is heating up ahead of Saturday’s presidential election in Taiwan, with the result set to reverberate far from the shores of this self-ruling island of 23 million, over which Beijing claims sovereignty and has repeatedly threatened to invade.With the race tight as the three candidates enter the final stretch, each has been holding rambunctious street rallies to energize their bases, while attempting to woo younger voters via pithy social media posts. According to last permitted polling before the vote, the China-skeptic incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of Vice-President William Lai holds a slender lead over the more Beijing-friendly Nationalists, or KMT, with the upstart centrist Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) in third place.Read More: The Ultimate Election Year: Half of World Heads to Polls in 2024Relations with China have dominated the discourse in the run-up to the Jan. 13 ballot. On Tuesday, the launch of a Chinese satellite that flew over the south of Taiwan prompted a bilingual air raid alert around 3:15 pm local time, blasted over loudspeakers and pinged to every cell phone. However, the English version of the alert mistranslated “satellite” as “missile,” prompting opposition politicians to accuse the DPP administration of purposefully stoking public anxiety to boost its own polling. (The government insists it was an honest mistake.)Certainly, Saturday’s vote will set the course of cross-strait ties for at least the next four years. The previous two terms of DPP government have witnessed a marked deterioration of relations between Taipei and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has branded Lai a “troublemaker” whose election would “only bring risks of fierce war.” Lai’s KMT and TPP rivals both argue that measured reengagement with Beijing will ultimately safeguard Taiwan’s de facto independence.Although China’s Qing Dynasty did encamp on parts of Taiwan, the CCP has never ruled the island, which was administered as a Japanese colony between 1895-1945 and became politically self-ruling at the end of China’s civil war in 1949. Nevertheless, Chinese President Xi Jinping used his new year’s speech on Dec. 31 to warn Taiwan voters that “reunification” was a “historical inevitability.”Taiwan’s status remains the most fraught of the myriad squabbles that today define relations between the world’s superpowers. The U.S. is obliged by act of Congress to sell Taiwan weapons for its own defense, including some $300 million of tactical communications equipment just last month. On four occasions, President Joe Biden has vowed to protect Taiwan from Chinese military aggression, while in San Francisco in November Xi told Biden that “China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable.”Read More: Biden Calls Xi a ‘Dictator’ Right After Praising Progress in Repairing U.S.-China RelationshipThe island’s future is also a matter of global concern given how pivotal it has become in supply chains. Taiwan is the world’s 16th-largest trading economy, exchanging $907 billion in goods and services in 2022, while producing 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductor chips that are vital for practically every industry. According to Rhodium Group estimates, a blockade on Taiwan would endanger over $2 trillion in economic activity even before sanctions or any military response. Meanwhile, Bloomberg Economics estimates that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan that draws the U.S. into war would cost the world economy $10 trillion.But with domestic growth in Taiwan in 2023 at just 1.4%—its slowest pace in eight years—voters are increasingly focused on boosting livelihoods assailed by Chinese boycotts and sanctions over the last eight years of DPP government. Beijing simply lifting its ban on Chinese tourists would boost Taiwan’s GDP by over 1%, according to Capital Economics. Anti-incumbency is a notable force, too; no party in Taiwan has won three straight terms since democratization in the late 1980s.“In democratic politics, after a certain duration of one party being in power, they’re going to face exhaustion and frustration and the urge to give somebody else a chance to see what they can do,” says Shelley Rigger, an East Asia expert at Davidson College in North Carolina and author of Why Taiwan Matters.In the 2020 election, outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen turned around abysmal approval ratings in large part by leveraging Taiwanese revulsion at Beijing’s crackdown on pro-democracy elements in semiautonomous Hong Kong. This time, however, Beijing has been subtler in its messaging. In March, Ma Ying-jeou, the last Taiwan President for the KMT, traveled to China on a goodwill visit—the first by a sitting or former leader of Taiwan since the civil war—thereby signaling to Taiwan’s voters that a path for improved relations exists.The DPP, in turn, has been desperately arguing that China’s territorial designs remain undiminished—and even go beyond the island. “China is actively engaged in authoritarian expansionism,” Lai told TIME in an exclusive interview in late October. “China is a regional hegemon, continuously expanding its influence, with an ambition to annex Taiwan and break past the first island chain,” he added, referring to the strategically important chain of islands comprising Japan, Taiwan, as well as parts of the Philippines and Indonesia.Read More: ‘The Best Way to Preserve Peace Is to Be Able to Fight a War’: Taiwan’s Foreign Minister on Resisting Chinese AggressionUltimately, the goal for Taiwan’s people is clear: improve livelihoods while safeguarding the island’s treasured democratic way of life. Saturday’s election will hinge on which candidate voters believe has the plan and aptitude to actually deliver it.“A lot of people in Taiwan are pretty nervous about what could go wrong in cross-strait relations,” says Rigger. “They don’t want to be the next Ukraine or the next Gaza, so the idea that you might have leaders who can actually talk to the other side and lower the temperature has an audience for sure.”",

        "title_text": "Video Footage Appears to Show Israeli Soldiers Shooting Palestinians in West Bank Unprovoked",
        "body_text": "BEIT RIMA, West Bank — Security camera video from a West Bank village shows a young man standing in a central square when he is suddenly shot and drops to the ground. Two others rushing to his aid are also hit, leaving a 17-year-old dead, moments before Israeli military jeeps roll in.An Associated Press review of the video and interviews with the two wounded survivors showed Israeli soldiers opened fire on the three when they did not appear to pose a threat. One of the wounded Palestinians was shot a second time after he got up and tried to hop away.The fatal shooting in the village of Beit Rima last week is the latest in a series of incidents in which soldiers appeared to fire without provocation, a trend Palestinians say has worsened since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza three months ago.Read More: Three Palestinian Students Shot in VermontThe Israeli military said troops entered Beit Rima overnight Thursday into Friday as part of a “counter-terrorism operation.” It said troops fired at suspects who threw explosives and firebombs at them.The video, obtained by the AP from a local smoke shop, does not show anyone throwing explosives.After reviewing the footage, a military spokesperson said soldiers reported that one of the Palestinians — visible kneeling in front of an object just outside the frame — was igniting a Molotov cocktail when he was shot.The video, however, shows that the first shot does not hit the kneeling man, but rather another Palestinian man, Nader Rimawi. Nader told the AP that the object was a stack of cardboard boxes and scraps of paper that 17-year-old Osaid Rimawi had gathered and was preparing to light to keep the men warm.Other videos of the shooting posted to social media and reviewed by AP appear consistent with Nader’s description of the object Osaid was preparing to light. It is possible videos taken from other angles could further illuminate what happened.In interviews with the AP, the wounded village residents denied having thrown explosives and said the shootings, about 2 a.m. Friday, were unprovoked.Read More: Inside the Israel-Hamas Information WarTwo of the six Rimawi brothers were in the town square when word spread that Israeli soldiers were in the village. They said they were aware of the army presence, but that there had been no confrontations. “We were with the young men standing at the roundabout of the town,” said Mohammed Rimawi, 25. “We started looking around as we were standing and not doing anything.”The half-hour security camera video begins about 20 minutes before the shootings with men gathering in small groups, walking in and out of the frame as cars come and go. Some men gesture elsewhere in the village.The crowd in the frame eventually thins to under 10 men. Then they scatter as a shot hits Mohammed’s brother, 29-year-old Nader, in the left leg.The video shows Mohammed running to help before being shot.“We saw a sniper who started shooting. He shot him. I went to help him. Then he shot me,” said Mohammed, who was struck by a bullet in his right hip.The video shows Osaid rushing to aid them as he slips something into his pocket. He is quickly shot and later dies of his wounds. His brother, Islam Rimawi, later told AP that he found a lighter, 20 shekels ($5.36), and a pack of cigarettes in Osaid’s pocket.Mohammed was able to crawl away, but the other two were left rolling on the ground. Nader stood up and attempted to hop away, before again collapsing to the ground. Speaking from his hospital bed days later, Nader said he collapsed after being shot in his right leg.Apart from Israeli troops carrying guns, no weapons are visible throughout the video. The shooter is not visible either.Read More: Is What’s Happening in Gaza a Genocide? Experts Weigh InThe video showed four armored Israeli vehicles arriving about 2 minutes after the shooting and roughly a dozen soldiers getting out, guns prone. They gathered around Mohammed. One soldier prodded Osaid with his foot. Within 4 minutes, the soldiers left the wounded Palestinians on the ground and drove away, ignoring the stack of boxes and declining to arrest them.Another video of the shooting reviewed by the AP shows the stack of boxes is then toppled by a Palestinian car rushing to evacuate the wounded.Shortly after, Osaid — a high school student studying to become a barber — was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.The military spokesperson said that there were other instances where Palestinians had thrown Molotov cocktails at the forces in Beit Rima that night but said he did not know when. The men shot in the video said this was the only altercation in Beit Rima they were aware of that night.The military did not respond when asked if soldiers had violated military policy and did not say whether there would be an official investigation.The Israeli rights group B’Tselem said that even if questionable shootings are caught on camera and investigated by the military, they rarely result in indictments.“Cases like these happen quite regularly, but no one’s hearing about them,” said Dror Sadot, a spokesperson for the group. “The military will say that it is opening an investigation. And this investigation will last for years, probably without any media covering it. And then it will be washed down the drain.”In response to Sadot’s allegation, a military spokesperson provided this statement: “Each investigation file is examined according to its circumstances. In the appropriate cases, various enforcement measures are taken, including the filing of indictments.”Human rights groups have previously presented cases in which soldiers opened fire without their lives being in danger, in apparent violation of the military's rules of engagement. In most cases, the victims were Palestinians, but Israelis have also been killed in high-profile shootings during the war.In December, three Israeli hostages who had escaped their Hamas captors in Gaza waved white flags and shouted for help in Hebrew before being gunned down by soldiers.Sadot said her organization has seen an unprecedented level of violence from soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since the war broke out. The West Bank is experiencing one of the deadliest phases on record, according to United Nations monitors.Beit Rima resident Ahmed Rimawi, whose two brothers were wounded in the shooting, said he believes soldiers have become more aggressive since the start of the war. In the past, they would initially fire stun grenades to disperse crowds in the village. Now, he said, “they open fire directly on people.”Read More: Why Netanyahu Can’t Talk About Post-War GazaPalestinian health officials said 340 Palestinians have been killed in the three tense months since Hamas militants attacked southern Israel and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.The Hamas attack prompted Israel to wage a blistering air and ground campaign on the Gaza Strip that has killed over 23,000 people — and to tighten its grip on the West Bank through near-nightly, often deadly, raids. Israel says the crackdown is aimed at Hamas and other militant groups.Mohammed and Nader are recovering from their wounds. Both normally work at a factory in a nearby Palestinian village, packaging prepared salads for market. They said they won’t work again until they are able to walk.Nader underwent surgery Sunday for injuries to his thigh. Mohammed has been released from the hospital but is unable to put weight on his right leg. He limps around the family's small ornate home in Beit Rima — a village of about 4,000 people north of the city of Ramallah — with the aid of a metal walker.Back at the village roundabout, the walls are plastered with the weathered faces of local men killed in encounters or clashes with Israeli forces. Among their ranks now appears Osaid's photograph, gazing over the pockmarked spot in the ground where he was killed.—Associated Press journalist Jalal Bwaitel in Beit Rima, West Bank contributed to this report.",

        "title_text": "South Korean Opposition Leader, After Being Stabbed in Neck, Urges End to ‘Warlike Politics’",
        "body_text": "Eight days after a harrowing stabbing of South Korea’s firebrand opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, the politician emerged from a Seoul hospital on Wednesday to greet the media and supporters with stirring resolve in his first public comments since the incident.The 59-year-old chairman of the Democratic Party of Korea, who at one point was in intensive care, underwent surgery to mend a major blood vessel in his neck after the attack in the southern port city of Busan. “I truly hope that this incident, which surprised all of us, will serve as a landmark in ending politics of hatred and confrontation and restoring decent politics in which we respect each other and co-exist,” Lee said. “We should put an end to warlike politics where we have to kill and eliminate opponents.”The same day, police announced the findings of their investigation into Lee’s assailant, a man in his 60s who had lunged at Lee while pretending to ask for an autograph.The suspect, identified only by his family name Kim, had committed the attack “out of subjective political beliefs,” Woo Chul-moon, head of the Busan Metropolitan Police Agency, said on Wednesday. He added that Kim told the police he wanted to kill Lee to “prevent him from becoming president” and “taking a majority of seats in the upcoming general elections.”Lee narrowly lost to President Yoon Suk Yeol, of the conservative People Power Party, in the country’s 2022 presidential election. National Assembly elections are scheduled for April this year.Read More: The Ultimate Election Year: Half of World Heads to Polls in 2024Kim, who was escorted into a vehicle outside a Busan police station on Wednesday, told reporters that he was “sorry” for causing concerns. The police have chosen not to disclose Kim’s full name, photo, or political party affiliation, citing legal reasons. While authorities had earlier detained another man in his 70s on suspicion of abetting Kim in the attack, the police concluded on Wednesday that Kim had acted alone without an accomplice.South Korea’s national police agency has pledged to prevent similar incidents by strengthening security for “key personnel.”The attack sent shockwaves through the nation and drew condemnation from figures across the political spectrum. Yoon’s office said in a statement that the act was “an enemy of liberal democracy” and wished Lee a speedy recovery. Yoon also ordered authorities to investigate the attack and support Lee’s medical treatment. Hong Ik Pyo from the Democratic Party—led by Lee—similarly said at a party meeting that the “act of terror” against Lee was “clearly a challenge against democracy.”However, despite the shared condemnation of the recent attack on Lee, divisions between the major political parties have continued to exacerbate in recent years. In a survey published last March by the Korea Institute of Public Administration, 93% of respondents cited the divide between conservatives and progressives as the most serious conflict faced by the country. Meanwhile, Yoon has been accused of fanning the flames of such polarization to shore up political support.Since his election defeat in 2022, Lee has been undergoing a series of investigations for charges that include bribery and breach of trust—allegations that he has denounced as politically motivated and even protested in a 24-day hunger strike last year.Lee’s trials, which have been delayed, were also cited as one of the motivations for Kim’s attack, police said, as Kim had felt that the politician was not being properly punished for the criminal charges.Despite the political wrangling and near-fatal attack, Lee appears undeterred in his electoral goals. On Wednesday, as Lee thanked the police and medical workers who treated him, he pledged to continue serving the public. “With this life that has been saved by the people,” he said, “I will live the rest of my life only for the people.”",

        "title_text": "Bhutan Opposition Party Wins Elections Amid Economic Threats to ‘Gross National Happiness’",
        "body_text": "Voters in Bhutan are putting new hope in their former Prime Minister, 58-year-old Tshering Tobgay, who has been elevated back into power amid increasing economic frustrations in the nation once dubbed the happiest in the world. According to the results of Tuesday’s election, announced by the election commission on Wednesday, Tobgay’s People’s Democratic Party is set to be the new ruling party, having won 30 of 47 seats in the national assembly. Meanwhile, the former ruling Bhutan Tendrel Party, which won the other 17 seats, returns to the opposition. (Three other parties were eliminated in an earlier round of voting held in November.)Read More: The Ultimate Election Year: Half of World Heads to Polls in 2024Bhutan, a landlocked kingdom of less than 1 million people in the Eastern Himalayas between India and China, was long ruled by absolute monarchy, but has held four parliamentary elections since 2008, when it converted to a constitutional monarchy.But as some 330,000 people (or 65.6% of eligible voters) cast their votes on Tuesday, the latest election coincided with a spiraling economic crisis that has cast doubts on the nation’s enduring focus on happiness, which some argue has come at the expense of economic growth.The pursuit of happiness has long been embedded in Bhutan’s governance. The idea of gauging the nation’s success by gross national happiness (GNH) instead of gross domestic product (GDP) was first proposed by the fourth King of Bhutan in 1972; in the years since, Bhutan’s leaders have promoted the index at international forums. Meant to measure development by the likes of psychological well-being and cultural diversity—factors that are excluded in calculations of the more widely used GDP—the alternative framework was initially hailed as a more holistic measure of development, especially amid growing cynicism about Western capitalism.But today, gloomy economic prospects are casting a shadow over Bhutan’s residents. The World Bank estimates that Bhutan’s GDP has grown at an average rate of just 1.6% in the last five years. And youth unemployment, which has plagued the nation for years and currently stands at 29%, has led to record numbers of young people migrating abroad in search of job opportunities. Tobgay, who led the government from 2013 to 2018, warned during his campaign of these “unprecedented economic challenges and mass exodus,” and he pledged to stimulate the economy by attracting greater foreign investment and expanding the tourism sector. His party has nevertheless also voiced its commitment to maintaining the national philosophy of measuring success by the “happiness and well-being of the people.”Tobgay has also been forthright in the past about the disparity between Bhutan’s “Shangri-la” reputation and its more bleak reality: “My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks,” he said during a TED Talk in 2016. “We are a small, underdeveloped country doing our best to survive.”",

        "title_text": "What to Know About South Africa’s Genocide Case Against Israel",
        "body_text": "Israel presented its defense before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday, Jan. 12, in the second day of oral proceedings, after South Africa filed a case against Israel for its “genocidal acts” against Palestinians in Gaza. Hundreds of protestors gathered outside the court ahead of the first set of oral proceedings at the Hague in the Netherlands, on Thursday.The suit was filed to the ICJ on Dec. 29. The ICJ is the main judicial body of the United Nations, which settles international disputes among member states and answers requests for advisory opinion on legal questions.An estimated 23,500 Palestinians are reported to have been killed since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people and kidnapped some 200 others. The Gaza Strip has experienced a shortage of resources since, with hospitals and churches subject to airstrikes, and limited international aid coming into the enclave.The court will not decide whether Israel is committing genocide, but instead will assess whether South Africa’s case is strong enough to issue provisional measures that would “protect against further, severe and irreparable harm” to Palestinians and “to ensure Israel’s compliance with its obligations under the Genocide Convention not to engage in genocide, and to prevent and to punish genocide,” the application against Israel says.The Organization of Islamic Countries, made up of 57 nations, in addition to tens of other countries—including Bolivia, Colombia and Brazil—have voiced their support of the case. The U.S. and Germany have voiced opposition. Here’s what to know about the case. On Friday, Israel’s team of attorneys extensively relayed the horrors of Oct. 7, sharing videos of Hamas’ actions. If the ICJ were to issue provisional measures against Israel, attorneys claim it would prevent Israel from acting with self-defense and would give Hamas time to expand their power. Attorneys representing the country rejected the notion that their military attacks on Gaza amounted to a genocide, and said that charging them with genocide would mean “the essence of this crime would be lost.” “The inevitable fatalities and human suffering of any conflict is not of itself a pattern of conduct that plausibly shows genocidal intent,” said Christopher Staker, representing Israel. Lawyers also said that Israeli forces were acting in accordance with international law by informing people about their bombings and attacks through calls and leafleting. When South Africa had the floor on Thursday, representatives focused on the mass destruction, displacement and death in Gaza. They also showed videos of Israeli soldiers who “film[ed] themselves joyfully detonating entire apartment blocks and town squares; erecting the Israeli flag over the wreckage,” South African lawyer Adila Hassim pointed out to the judge panel.  “Violence and destruction in Palestine and Israel did not begin on the 7th of Oct. 2023, the Palestinians have experienced systematic oppression and violence for the last 76 years,” South African Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said to the court.“No armed attack on a state territory, no matter how serious, even an attack involving atrocity crimes can provide any justification for or defense to breaches to the [Genocide] Convention.” Lawyers representing South Africa also pointed to the bombing of hospitals, attacks on civilians, and lack of sufficient aid being allowed in to help Palestinians. Military actions in Gaza have wiped out generations, pointing to the creation of a new acronym: WCNSF, which stands for wounded child, no surviving family, Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh said. Israel defended itself by saying they had evidence that Hamas was using “every single hospital in Gaza.” South Africa outlayed  what they argued were genocidal statements, including some by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Israel’s special genocidal intent is rooted in the belief that in fact the ‘enemy’ is not just the military wing of Hamas, or indeed Hamas generally, but is embedded in the fabric of Palestinian life in Gaza,” said Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, also representing South Africa.Israel denied that any statements made by senior Israeli officials were policy, claiming that they were rhetorical. Attorneys representing Israel also questioned whether the ICJ has jurisdiction over the case because there were no negotiations between South Africa and Israel. On Thursday, John Dugard, a South African professor of international law, told the ICJ that they have jurisdiction over the case under Article 9, which does not require states to negotiate before pursuing a case in court. Lior Haiat, spokesperson of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously claimed that South Africa was acting as “the legal arm of the Hamas terrorist organization.” Zane Dangor, director general of South Africa’s Ministry of International Relations, denied that claim.South Africa submitted an application to institute proceedings against Israel on Dec. 29, 2023, for “alleged violations by Israel” under the Genocide Convention.In the 84-page application, South Africa cites United Nations experts who have, for week, sounded the alarm of the risk of genocide against Palestinians. The application points to evidence including, but not limited to: statements by Israeli state representatives that they say express genocidal intent; the deprivation of access to food and water; blockage of humanitarian aid; killing civilians; causing serious mental and bodily harm; and mass expulsion and displacement of Palestinians.Israel has denied that it has violated international law during its military campaign in Gaza. “The use of the term ‘genocide’ in relation to Israel’s lawful targeting of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist organizations in Gaza empties the term of meaning,” reads a Q&A published on the Israeli Defense Forces website. “Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza. It is committed to conducting its operations in accordance with international law and wishes no harm to Palestinian civilians anywhere.”The case is currently at the provisional measures stage, meaning “South Africa is not asking the court to rule definitively that Israel is committing genocide,” Rutgers Law School professor Adil Haque says. Instead, South Africa is asking the ICJ to issue an order that would be similar to a preliminary injunction in a U.S. court and “preserve the status quo,” Lea Brilmayer, a professor of international law at Yale Law School, adds.South Africa is specifically requesting Israel to “halt all military attacks that constitute or give rise to violations of the Genocide Convention,” according to their court application. They also ask that Israel “cease killing and causing serious mental and bodily harm to Palestinian people in Gaza” and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. The court has the power to order Israel to comply with all of South Africa’s requests, or it may only issue some orders. Scholars could not concretely provide a timeframe for when the ICJ would issue their decision after the oral arguments. Some said it could take weeks, if not longer. Francis Boyle—a professor at University of Illinois College of Law who serves as counsel to the Provisional Government of the Palestinian Authority—says it could be even faster. He notes that the massive Palestinian death toll due to the ongoing military offensive in Gaza creates urgency in this case.Either way, if the ICJ does rule in favor of South Africa, the provisional measures would only be temporary. Judges would later have to decide if the case could move forward to the merits phase, which would lead to a fully-fledged trial between South Africa and Israel during which the court would decide whether Israel committed genocide. A decision on that would take years, according to experts. A separate case has also been opened in the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is reviewing actions taken by Israeli officials since the war and “conduct that may amount to Rome Statute crimes committed since 13 June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” per a Nov. 17 statement. The ICC differs from the ICJ in that it is a criminal court that prosecutes individuals for their actions. There is also an ongoing case in the U.S. federal court against President Joe Biden, Secretary Antony Blinken, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “for their failure to prevent—and complicity in—the genocide” against Palestinians. The case, which was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, will be heard in Oakland, Calif. on Jan. 26.  The ICJ’s orders are legally binding—but experts warn that the ICJ does not have the power to enforce a state to abide by its judgment. “It's an institution that enforces its judgments through public pressure, because it looks very bad for a country to defy an order from the ICJ because it's very prestigious and authoritative,” Brilmayer notes. “The ICJ is basically stuck if it comes up against a state who refuses to comply with the order.”Haque points to a similar case filed by Ukraine against Russia in February 2022 as a possible precedent. While the case is still pending in the courts, judges issued a provisional measure telling Russia to “suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine” and that any military support must take “no steps in furtherance of these military operations.” But Russia has not ended its ongoing military campaign. The U.N. Security Council has the authority to enforce ICJ orders, but countries like the U.S. and Russia have veto power, making them and their allies immune to demands. Boyle says that the UN General Assembly could issue a resolution for enforcement on the matter, but other experts note that even that action could be ignored. “The court orders will more likely be the basis for a wide variety of states to criticize Israel if it does not comply, and use other means to try to pressure Israel to comply with whatever the orders turn out to be,” Haque says. Still, Alexander Hinton, the UNESCO Chair in Genocide Prevention at Rutgers University, says that pursuing this legal avenue is worthwhile. Having South Africa file this case could be evidence of a trend towards greater universal care, he suggests. All member states are permitted to present a case about genocide to the ICJ under the UN Genocide Convention, and this would not be the first time a third-party brings forward a case to the ICJ about genocide; in 2019, Gambia, presented a case against Myanmar for its genocide against the Rohingya. But having a country that does not neighbor Israel file the claim is significant.Settling international matters may be slow, but Hinton says “there is a worth to determine the facts to render a judgment and to morally and legally implicate [an entity] who could be found to violate the genocide treaty.”",

        "title_text": "Israel’s Bitter Lessons From the Hamas War, Three Months In",
        "body_text": "This week marks three months of war that continues to devastate Gaza as the bodies and rubble pile up in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. What are the lessons to be learned, so far, from a Middle East war like no other?It is the first war, since Israel’s creation in 1948, that the Jewish state is fighting on six fronts. In addition to Gaza, there is a marked upsurge in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and other radical pro-Iran Shia groups in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, visiting Israeli leaders on Tuesday, expressed concern that the entire region may succumb to instability. The U.S. and Israel agree that Iran is not-so-secretly stirring up these conflicts, but the Biden Administration insists that Israel’s smartest move now would be to lower the level of combat in Gaza and to focus on an exit strategy. Yet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared recently that the war will continue for many months.The first lesson is that Israel is barely capable of conducting battles on all these fronts at once. Lebanon is particularly vexing, as Netanyahu’s government threatens Gaza-like destruction if Hezbollah doesn’t pull back from Israel’s border, as tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from their towns and farms in northern Israel. This stands in sharp contrast to years of boasting by the Israel Defense Forces and leaders that the IDF was capable of repelling all military challenges from any direction. There hasn’t been another disaster like Oct. 7, but the array of lethal threats suggests a worrying conclusion: that Israel is weaker than at any time in its 75-year history. In 1967, the IDF astounded the world by defeating Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in six days—capturing the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. But in more than 90 days, it has not been able to achieve victory in Gaza; the total elimination of Hamas is a seemingly impossible goal. The Israeli military estimates that 8,000 Hamas fighters have been killed since the war began, among the more than 23,000 Gazans listed as dead by the Strip’s Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza’s launchers and rockets, especially the long-range ones which were reaching Tel Aviv, have also been destroyed. But Hamas is still able to fire an occasional barrage toward Israel, where almost all have been intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system. A second lesson is that Israeli commando units—considered to be right up there with Seal Team 6 as the best in the world—have not been able to rescue the hostages. Only one was found and freed by the IDF, which later suffered the shame of shooting dead three Israelis who were shirtless and waving a makeshift white flag. Some 136 hostages, including eight U.S. citizens, remain in Gaza and an IDF spokesman tells us that around 25 of them are “known” to be dead. It is a macabre fact that both sides are holding corpses to be part of hostages-for-prisoners exchanges.A third lesson is that while Israelis count on American support, the warm backing expressed by President Joe Biden has limits. He authorized $3 billion in military aid to Israel, including 14,000 missiles for Iron Dome, and is asking Congress for $14 billion more. Yet on Monday, Biden declared that he is “quietly” putting pressure on Israel to “significantly get out of Gaza.” Secretary Blinken may be finding, as he visits Israel and other countries in the region, that Netanyahu is slightly toning down the combat. But can Netanyahu keep fending off Biden and Blinken’s burning questions: When will you stop the war? When will you let in more aid to Gaza? And what is the plan for the “day after” as Washington looks to kickstart a moribund two-state solution.A fourth lesson centers on Netanyahu himself. He is continuing to play politics, postponing any investigation into who’s to blame for the security failures of Oct. 7, while he tries to wear the mantle of a heroic wartime Prime Minister. Israeli columnists highlighted the CIA’s conclusion that he is prolonging the war for his own selfish interests, to remain in power as corruption charges continue to play out at a snail’s pace in court. To maintain his coalition, he keeps bending to the will of extreme rightwing cabinet ministers who are intent on retaining the West Bank forever—and now talk about taking over the Gaza Strip and expelling the 2.2 million Palestinians who live there.Every Middle East crisis brings to mind some instances of missed opportunities: roads not traveled that could have led to more peaceful outcomes. We think of various trips to Saudi Arabia, at the time kept secret, by the then Mossad spy chief Tamir Pardo, the head of military intelligence General Aviv Kochavi, and the IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz. The head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, urged them to give up territories captured in 1967 and credibly commit to the two-state solution. But Netanyahu rejected the Saudi peace plan in favor of the status quo. Since then, Netanyahu’s “divide and rule” tactics have backfired. For years, he let Qatar deliver billions of dollars to Hamas to prevent the emergence of a unified Palestinian leadership, recently boasting that he’s proud to have blocked the creation of a Palestinian state. That approach helped Hamas win more recruits and build up its military strength, including the construction of the tunnels that the IDF struggles to locate, clear, and destroy without killing all the hostages.The results of Netanyahu’s narrow-minded path have led to catastrophe for both Israelis and Palestinians and nearly constant border fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Elsewhere in the region, trouble has been brewing with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacking international shipping in the Red Sea and the accelerated nuclear enrichment by Tehran—the kind of regional instability that President Biden feared. Both the U.S. and Israel—as Middle East commentators declare with either alarm or pleasure—appear weak and vulnerable. There are more lessons still to be learned, and they are likely to be bitter ones.",

        "title_text": "State of Emergency Declared in Papua New Guinea After Rioting and Looting Kills 16",
        "body_text": "A state of emergency has been declared in Papua New Guinea’s capital amid deadly riots which have reportedly killed at least 16 people.The state of emergency, which will last 14 days, was declared Thursday by Prime Minister James Marape, who also announced that the Pacific Island nation’s Chief of Police, David Manning, had been suspended along with other top bureaucrats across the finance and treasury departments amid a probe into the unrest that began with a payroll dispute by police and other public servants.“There was evidence of organized rioting that took place yesterday,” Marape said in a press conference Thursday. “Where the organization came from, that investigation will ascertain.”Local media outlets reported that shops were burned down, businesses looted, and innocent bystanders assaulted in Port Moresby, as havoc was wreaked nationwide on Wednesday. Protesters stormed Manasupe Haus, home to the Prime Minister’s office, setting fire to its guardhouse and other items in front of its gates. The U.S. embassy in Port Moresby also alerted that shots were fired near its compound. In an update Thursday, officials told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that Port Moresby General Hospital confirmed nine local deaths, and seven deaths in the city of Lae, the nation’s second largest. Local businesses have also suffered severe economic losses, and an estimated 5,000 Papua New Guineans have become unemployed as a result of the unrest, according to local newspaper The National.“We have faced an unprecedented time in our history,” Port Moresby's National Capital District Governor Powes Parkop said in a Facebook livestream on Wednesday. “Our priority is to bring safety and security to our people, to our country, to our families.”The unrest originated when public servants, including police, went on strike over unexplained deductions of up to $100 in their latest wages—which ABC reports is about half the pay of junior staff. The cut’s alleged links to an increase in taxes sparked outrage among the disgruntled public workers, so in response, they stopped working and took to the streets.The country’s Internal Revenue Commission has denied any such tax increase. Internal Security Minister Peter Tsiamalili also issued a denial when speaking to the protesting police, pinning their docked pay on a “glitch” in the government’s payroll system. Prime Minister Marape echoed this, Papua New Guinea’s The National reported, saying that the finance department would fix the anomaly and that the deducted wages would be included in their next pay period.Local reports suggested bad actors piggybacked on the protests and reports of businesses being looted streamed in by the afternoon. Local newspaper Post Courier reported that supermarkets were ransacked, some patients in some hospitals were evacuated and, outside its newsroom, shots were heard. Reports of looting extended as far as Lae, 190 miles north of the capital.Videos shared on social media showed buildings burning in Port Moresby, and some Chinese businesses were also attacked—prompting Beijing to issue “solemn representations” with the government of the Pacific nation, according to AFP.Since the riots were led by police personnel and public servants who might normally respond to such unrest, the Papua New Guinea government deployed its military. Approximately 180 law enforcement personnel were reportedly deployed to the capital to respond to the uproar. More than 1,000 troops were also on standby to intervene, according to Marape’s national address.Soldiers patrolled the streets of the Gerehu commercial area on Thursday morning, warning against causing any disturbance. A video on social media shows one soldier appealing to incensed residents to calm down.In response to the violence, Marape said that the government will rectify the pay error, but he added that there were other ways to respond to such grievances. “[For] issues that are legitimate, [there are] avenues in which those issues must be raised,” Marape said, according to The National. He added in a press conference Thursday that it was “not right” for anyone to “take to the streets to do anything and everything they feel needs to be done.”The civil unrest comes at a sensitive political time for Papua New Guinea, which finds itself straddling between the interests and inroads of the U.S. and China, each vying for greater influence in the Pacific region. China called on the Papua New Guinea government to take “swift and effective” measures to protect its nationals there, after China’s foreign affairs ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in a press conference Thursday that two Chinese nationals suffered from minor injuries during the riots.Meanwhile, Papua New Guinea residents have already been cash-strapped due to the cost of living crisis and high unemployment rates, which opposition leader Joseph Lelang told ABC Radio Australia was an underlying reason for the protests. “That is their constitutional right to go and express their grievances about this matter,” he said.Marape has previously said his goal is to expand the nation's economy to 200 billion kina ($55 billion) by 2029. But he may soon face a vote of no confidence in parliament, as the 18-month grace period for such a vote is set to expire in February. A successful no-confidence motion would result in Papua New Guinea choosing a new Prime Minister in a snap parliamentary election.",

        "body_text": "The small Southeast Asian nation of Brunei has for several years been home to one of the world’s most swoon-worthy royals and one of Asia’s “most eligible bachelors”—though Prince Abdul Mateen, who is still regularly described as “hot,” “sexy,” and variations thereof, has now given up the latter title.The 32-year-old trained helicopter pilot and major in the Royal Brunei Air Force—known for winning sports medals in polo, hanging out with tigers, and amassing 2.5 million Instagram followers—is marrying his “commoner” (non-royal) fiancée, 29-year-old Anisha Rosnah Isa-Kalebic, in a part-traditional, part-grandiose 10-day royal nuptial festival this month that began on Jan. 7 and will end on Jan. 16.The solemnization ceremony, which officially legalizes the marriage before further days of celebration, took place on Thursday, Jan. 11, at the gold-domed Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque. Only male guests—mostly ministers and government officials, and excluding even the bride—were allowed to attend the ceremony in the mosque.  Prince Mateen is the son of Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, one of the world’s richest royals with an estimated net worth of nearly $28 billion—evidenced by his several jets, hundreds of Rolls Royces and Ferraris, and a palace with 1,700 rooms. Prince Mateen, sixth in line to the throne, is the Sultan’s fourth son and 10th child. Anisha Rosnah is the granddaughter of one of the Sultan’s special advisors, Pehin Dato Isa—the founding chairman of the Royal Brunei Airlines. Media reports say Anisha Rosnah runs a fashion brand called Silk Collective and co-owns a tourism company called Authentirary with a friend.The engagement of the two was announced in October 2023, but they’re believed to have been dating for years, though details of their courtship remain scant. The couple was seen together at the wedding ceremonies of Mateen’s sisters Princess Azemah Ni'matul Bolkiah in 2023 and Princess Fadzilah in 2022.Previous Brunei royal wedding ceremonies have similarly lasted several days, given the multiple events involved. Local media outlet The Scoop reports that the schedule kicked off with a royal proposal on Jan. 7. The highlight of the festivities is the reception, which took place in the sultanate palace Istana Nurul Iman on Jan. 14.A reported 5,000 guests attended the reception, including foreign dignitaries and world leaders. Among the royal families who reportedly took part in the event were Malaysia’s King Abdullah and Queen Azizah, Bhutan’s King Jigme and Queen Jetsun Pema, as well as Jordan’s Princess Noor Asem and her husband Amr Fareed Zaidan. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., were also reportedly in attendance.After the reception, the newlywed Brunei royal couple embarked on a procession through the streets of the capital, Bandar Seri Bagawan, in a grand parade, at which thousands of Bruneians stood under the hot sun to get a glimpse of Prince Abdul Mateen and his wife.",

        "title_text": "How Poetry Became a Tool of Resistance for Palestinians ",
        "body_text": "Weeks before he was killed by an Israeli airstrike, Palestinian poet Refaat Alareer shared his 2011 poem If I Must Die. “If I must die/you must live/to tell my story,” the poem reads.  The persona then invites readers to make and fly white kites in his honor, so that a child in Gaza, who only knows hardship, “sees the kite, my kite you made, flying up above/and thinks for a moment an angel is there/bringing back love.”  Since his death in Northern Gaza on Dec. 6, his words have taken on new significance—not least for how they capture the civilian experience, but also for how they serve as a self-written eulogy for the late poet. Alareer was a comparative literature professor at the Islamic University of Gaza. He also edited Gaza Unsilenced and Light in Gaza: Writings Born of Fire, which compiled writings from Gazans contending with life under occupation. Alareer was debating whether to leave his home with his wife and six children when he was killed along with his brother, sister, and her four children.What began as Israel’s retaliation to Hamas’ surprise attack on Oct. 7—which killed 1,200 people and saw over 240 people taken hostage—has now escalated into an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe and mass displacement of Palestinians. Since the beginning of the war more than 23,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including 13 Palestinian poets and 68 journalists. Palestinians say writers are being deliberately targeted by occupation forces. Read More: The Voice Notes Poet Refaat Alareer Sent Before His Death“Everyone is a target in Gaza,” Mosab Abu Toha, a 31-year-old revered Palestinian poet, scholar, and founder of Gaza’s Edward Said library, tells TIME from Cairo.Abu Toha was arrested on Nov. 20 while fleeing from Northern Gaza to the south, heading for the Rafah crossing which borders Egypt. Despite having word from U.S. officials that his family would be allowed to enter Egypt, he was arrested at an Israeli checkpoint. He was stripped, beaten, and handcuffed when Israeli forces accused him of being a Hamas activist without evidence, he says. “In my case I think I was taken on purpose. There are other people taken at random. But for me, it was not random. It was not a mistake,” he says.He adds that he was only released after two days as a result of the pressure from international media outlets who reported on his detention. “They wanted to humiliate me, they wanted to beat me, to punish me for speaking and writing about what I have seen in Gaza,” Abu Toha says. “They are trying to kill the voice, to kill the people who speak.” The practice of targeting Palestinian writers predates the current aggression. Since the 1930s, Palestinian poetry has grappled with the suffering furnished by colonial powers, says Atef Alshaer, a Senior Lecturer in Arabic Language and Culture at London’s University of Westminster. He adds that at times, this poetry foresaw what would happen to Palestinians, from the mass creation of refugees as a result of the 1948 Nakba—the catastrophe in which 80% of the population was displaced—to long term dispossession and exile since Israel’s founding. For Palestinians, poetry is “compensation for their lack of physical power,” Alshaer says. “They have been exposed to these practices of violence by the Israeli occupation and left with nothing, so they have used their voice to the maximum [extent] possible.” For displaced Palestinians, poetry is a space to rebuild their homeland through words, and make it “visible through such vivid and relatable language so anybody in the world could read that poetry and be somehow moved by it,” Alshaer says. As such, poetry has been used as a powerful instrument of persuasion for the Palestinian cause, propelling the endurance of literary greats such as Mahmoud Darwish, Fadwa Tuqan, and Najwan Darwish.  Najwan Darwish, a prominent Jerusalem-based Palestinian poet with eight poetry books published in Arabic, tells TIME that it is painful when readers around the globe turn to older works of Palestinian poetry, including his, to make sense of today’s events.  “I am not happy when I see my poetry used in the war, in this genocide, because I wish this poetry would become invalid,” he says. In The Shelling Ended, he writes: “The shelling ended/only to start again within you./The buildings fell/the horizon burned,/only for flames to rage inside you,/flames that will devour even stone.”After 20 years of writing about violence enacted on Gaza across multiple Israeli aggressions, he has seen his poetry reshared each time. “It’s dark that they are timeless,” Darwish says. Despite the lack of institutional stability afforded to Palestinians through Israeli occupation—and the continued destruction of schools and universities in Gaza—Palestinians maintain a national literacy rate of 97.7%. But Darwish says that poetry, and any form of creation, is rendered near impossible by Israel’s bombardment. A writer needs a space and time to focus, which has not been possible for Gazans, he explains.    Darwish adds that the current destruction in Gaza has caused immeasurable archival loss for writers. “For any colonial project, the main target is the land, but culture is also targeted.” By mid-December, 352 school buildings in Gaza had been damaged, according to the Guardian. Writers in Gaza are also faced with the destruction of libraries, both public and personal, and book collections. “The only thing that a writer cares about is their library. We don't have anything more worthy than libraries, it’s an obsession,” Darwish says, adding that the import of books into blockaded Gaza is no easy task, making each collected book that more special. Abu Toha says his personal library has been destroyed and he remains unsure of the fate of the Edward Said libraries he founded, of which there are two branches: “I am sure they were destroyed along with hundreds of other institutions, universities and cultural centers in the Gaza strip.”  Poetry takes on a slightly different role for Palestinian poets in the diaspora. It serves as a way to revisit the home that many of them have never and will never see due to their lack of a right to return. There’s a safety afforded to writers who are not living under occupation—but it’s not without its creative limitations.“There's a way that as diaspora Palestinians, we tend to romanticize and view Palestine through this limited sets of symbols,” says George Abraham, a Palestinian-American poet. They are the editor of Mizna, a SWANA literary magazine, and co-editor of a 2025 poetry anthology of Palestinian voices, which will include work from the late poets Alareer and Hiba Abu Nada.Read More: Listening to the Voices of Young People From Gaza“There's a level of privilege that structures my life in ways that are not experienced by Palestinians in the homeland,” Abraham says. As such, Abraham says it’s important to use this privilege to platform and uplift writers from their community that have not been afforded the same opportunities. In “Taking Back Jerusalem,” they write: “I’m trying to understand what makes/one’s existence, at a fixed location, a radical/act—divine even—& what makes/the existence of another, near a specific body/of water, a violence. Forgive me. I wrote this/in an american airport,/& its magic escaped me.”But as an editor who collaborates with writers in Gaza, this has resulted in some of Abraham’s contributors—such as Alareer—being killed by airstrikes. Abraham’s upcoming anthology will include two of Alareer's pieces.Nonetheless, Abraham says it’s imperative that poetry is just one tool in the process for Palestinian liberation and resistance against ethnic cleansing. “Poetry can't stop a bullet. Poetry won't free a prisoner. And that's why we need to do the political organizing work as well,” they say. “But if we can't imagine a free liberated world in language, how can we build one?” ",

        "body_text": "GENEVA — The head of the U.N. health agency said Wednesday holiday gatherings and the spread of the most prominent variant globally led to increased transmission of COVID-19 last month.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said nearly 10,000 deaths were reported in December, while hospital admissions during the month jumped 42% in nearly 50 countries—mostly in Europe and the Americas—that shared such trend information.\"Although 10,000 deaths a month is far less than the peak of the pandemic, this level of preventable deaths is not acceptable,\" the World Health Organization director-general told reporters from its headquarters in Geneva.He said it was “certain” that cases were on the rise in other places that haven't been reporting, calling on governments to keep up surveillance and provide continued access to treatments and vaccines.MORE: Is It Dangerous to Keep Getting COVID-19?Tedros said the JN.1 variant was now the most prominent in the world. It is an Omicron variant, so current vaccines should still provide some protection.Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead at WHO for COVID-19, cited an increase in respiratory diseases across the globe due to the coronavirus but also flu, rhinovirus and pneumonia.“We expect those trends to continue into January through the winter months in the northern hemisphere,” she said, while noting increases in COVID-19 in the southern hemisphere—where it's now summer.While bouts of coughs, sniffling, fever, and fatigue in the winter are nothing new, Van Kerkhove said this year in particular, \"we are seeing co-circulation of many different types of pathogens.”WHO officials recommend that people get vaccinated when possible, wear masks, and make sure indoor areas are well ventilated.“The vaccines may not stop you being infected, but the vaccines are certainly reducing significantly your chance of being hospitalized or dying,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, head of emergencies at WHO.",

        "body_text": "The European Union is headed for a consequential election in June 2024. More than 400 million people are eligible to vote in the first parliamentary elections since Brexit, making it the second largest democratic electoral process in the world after India’s elections. Those who are elected this year will determine the continent’s policies on major issues ranging from the war in Ukraine, the regulation of new artificial intelligence technology, to the economic bloc’s policies towards migration. But the election is not the only major event happening in Europe this summer. Taylor Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour will also be headed to Europe from May 9 to Aug. 17. European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas has taken notice. “No one can mobilize youth better than young people,” Schinas said at a press conference on Wednesday, referring to the pop singer. “It’s young people who can mobilize young people to participate, more than commissioners.”Read More: Person of the Year 2023: Taylor SwiftSwift, who was TIME’s person of the year in 2023, has yet to make a statement on the EU elections. In the past, she has encouraged her fan base to vote and participate in the democratic process, and Schinas hopes she will post similar messages of encouragement for her European fans. \"Taylor Swift will be in Europe in May,\" Schinas said. \"I very much hope that she does the same for young Europeans and I very much hope that someone from her media team follows this press conference and relays this request to her.\"Schinas referred to the measurable impact Swift can have on voter registration. \"Just to give you an example: Taylor Swift, last September—she made a social media call to young Americans to register to vote. The day after her post, 35,000 young Americans had registered to vote,\" Schinas said, referring to an instagram story Swift posted on Sept. 19. Vote.org, a non-profit organization that provides online voter registration guidelines in every state, confirmed that in the hour after Swift’s instagram post, the website saw a 1226% jump in participation. “By the end of the day we had over 38,000 registrations that came through vote.org,” Andrea Hailey, the CEO of Vote.org told CBS news in September. Swift herself initially walked a careful line when it came to politics over the course of her career, not sharing any political opinions with the public until Oct. 2018, when she endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen over Republican Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee’s Senate race.

        "title_text": "It’s the World’s Biggest Election Year. Is Democracy Good for Climate Change?",
        "body_text": "This year is the biggest election year on record. Voters in more than 60 countries—including four of the five most populated—will go to the polls in 2024. And in all of them, climate change is unavoidably on the ballot. Last year was the hottest year on record; this year is expected to be even hotter. The actions that countries take in the coming years will determine the trajectory of future emissions. Yet, despite this reality, climate change remains largely on the electoral campaign backburner. These two facts side by side—the urgent need to address climate change and the widespread apathy toward the issue in a critical election year—point to an important reality: efforts to tackle climate change face a democracy challenge. The critical timing of this election year, when nations must rapidly accelerate climate action to keep any hope of meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals alive, offers a lens into the knotty challenges of building democratic support for climate policy. Democracies move on public sentiment, and the best time to galvanize public support is around elections. This year, climate change remains a relatively low priority for the average voter in most places across the globe, seemingly less pressing than immediate economic concerns. For many politicians, the easy solution is to kick the can down the road until after their next election. But doing so also poses a threat to democracy. The challenges created by climate change—unchecked migration, economic stagnation, and the loss of homeland, to name a few—are precisely the kind of developments that have historically fomented authoritarian sentiments.So, as this landmark election year proceeds, it’s worth considering climate’s place in it—both how the candidates will shape climate policy, and how that will shape the future of democracy.A version of this story also appears in the Climate is Everything newsletter. To sign up, click hereThe biggest headline-grabbing election here in the U.S. is of course the likely contest for the White House between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump, and it’s a useful one to understand the challenge of addressing climate change in a democracy. Biden’s previous campaign galvanized young voters concerned about climate change, and he has enacted the biggest climate investment legislation in the country’s history. But the climate issue has faded from the headlines in 2024. That’s in part because other concerns—including, most significantly, the candidates’ fitness for office—have taken precedence, but it’s also because the candidates have taken to talking around climate change rather than talk about it directly. Biden’s rhetoric portrays his climate agenda as an economic agenda. “When I think of climate change, I think of jobs,” he likes to say. Trump also talks about climate as an economic matter, by trashing Biden’s agenda as a job-killing boogeyman. Last year, for example, he traveled to a Michigan auto parts manufacturer set to lose business thanks to the transition to electric vehicles. “You’re going to lose your beautiful way of life,” Trump told a crowd in Michigan in September. “For auto workers, Biden's forced transition is a transition to hell.”India, which will hold general elections this spring, offers another interesting example. The country is squarely in the center of the climate challenge. Parts of India are particularly vulnerable to the effects of rising global temperatures, think of heat waves and flooding, and its rapidly developing economy means that it emits a growing share of global greenhouse gas emissions. But, while the major political parties there have issued platforms acknowledging the need to act on climate change, the issue isn’t expected to feature prominently in the campaigns. Analysts expect the election to center on the controversial tenure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as coalition-building and traditional bread-and-butter issues.Last year, I asked members of the Indian parliament across the political spectrum about how their constituents viewed climate change and got a near-universal answer: it’s not top of mind. Rahul Kaswan, a member of parliament from the Indian state of Rajasthan, told me last year that even as temperatures topped 120°F last year in the state he represents, the issue of “climate change” isn’t his voters’ top concern. “Yes, climate change is impacting people in my constituency,” he said at an event I moderated at the University of Chicago. But “we have a growing state right now, and we need power 24/7. That's the most important thing right now.”Both elections speak to the core of climate change’s democracy challenge. Climate change, as urgent as the scientific reality may be, feels less urgent to voters than their economic challenges. And elected officials respond to that to win elections. In Europe, where voters will elect members to the European Parliament in June, climate change is running up against a different sort of democracy problem. For decades, the E.U. has taken a leading role combating climate change, in large part because the public supported it. The bloc implemented a carbon pricing mechanism in 2005, for example, and more recently created a Green Deal program designed to bring down Europe’s emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. But fear has grown that some citizens feel recent measures have gone too far. Last year, German industry created an uproar over the bloc’s aggressive electric vehicle regulations, and Dutch farmers launched a revolt over policies that target high-emitting fertilizer. The high cost of energy, primarily due to ripples from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have created political tensions across the continent. Many in Brussels fear that those concerns have contributed to the recent spike in right-wing populism that has long been simmering on the continent. In the Netherlands, most obviously, voters last fall dumped the longtime prime minister in favor of a far-right candidate. Europeans remain overwhelmingly supportive of taking action on climate—nearly 90% of E.U. citizens say the bloc should be climate neutral by 2050—but actually getting there without angering voters remains a delicate task. Climate change’s democracy challenge has come up time and again in my reporting over the years. No one has the silver bullet to fix it, but there is a common thread among those who think about it: something needs to be change so that the policy timeline in democracies can match the urgency of the climate crisis.TIME receives support for climate coverage from the Outrider Foundation.

        "title_text": "Gaza Is Being Starved. Could Airdropping Food Be the Answer?",
        "body_text": "Gaza is being starved. Since Israel’s war to root out Hamas from the densely-populated enclave began three months ago, normal flows of food, water, and other basic necessities into the Strip have ceased. What little resources get in are scarce and prohibitively expensive. Malnutrition, particularly among children, is rife. Famine, the U.N.’s emergency relief chief warns, is just “around the corner.”Amid these desperate times, desperate measures have been taken—more recently by France and Jordan, which last week resorted to parachuting seven tons of emergency medical aid onto a Jordanian field hospital in Gaza using C-130 transport planes. Although French President Emmanuel Macron’s office did not say whether the “extremely complex operation” would be repeated, it noted that the mission “allows us to show that such operations are possible.”Now that it has, some observers are calling for food aid to be next. “So many countries that would otherwise send aid have to go through these long, laborious processes to get food aid and then they have to think about who’s going to receive it in Gaza and who is going to distribute it,” says Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a U.S.-based Middle East analyst who has been advocating for airdrops as a means to address the hunger crisis in his native Gaza, where much of his family remains. By arranging aerial food drops in coordination with the Israeli military, as Jordan is said to have done on previous occasions, Alkhatib believes that the international community can help prevent a looming famine in Gaza all the while bypassing many of the logistical challenges that have hindered land convoys.Read More: How Experts Believe Starvation Is Being Utilized in GazaPrior to Oct. 7, around 500 trucks of aid would go into Gaza each day to meet the needs of its 2.2 million population, the overwhelming majority of which relied on humanitarian assistance. But since the beginning of the war, that number has reduced to a trickle. While efforts have been taken to increase the level of aid coming into Gaza (most notably through last month’s opening of the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem border crossing, which unlike the pedestrian Rafah crossing was designed for the transit of commercial goods), only around 120 trucks are entering the Strip per day, according to U.N. estimates—a bottleneck that has been spurred by long queues and arbitrary Israeli inspections. What little aid does get into Gaza must then overcome distribution challenges, among them communication blackouts, damaged roads, and constant bombardment.Last month, Israel signaled that it would allow humanitarian assistance from several European countries to be transmitted to Gaza on ships via Cyprus, where the aid would undergo security checks. Alkhatib says that a similar process could be introduced to facilitate food airdrops. “You can easily, as the U.N. has done, put food like flour, grains, and other items in reinforced bags that can be put on pallets and freely dropped without parachutes from the back of cargo airplanes,” he says, citing previous instances of food airdrops in places such as South Sudan and DR Congo. He says that such airdrops could be directed not only to civilian centers in the south of Gaza, where the vast majority of the population has fled, but also to those remaining in the north, which has largely become inaccessible.Some experts warn that humanitarian airdrops are not as simple as they sound. Aside from the cost of conducting them (up to seven times more than land transport, according to the U.N.’s World Food Programme), airdrops tend to be less efficient and more hazardous than other methods of providing humanitarian relief. “The operations are not without risk,” Michel Schaffner, the head of air operations at the International Committee of the Red Cross, told TIME in an email. He noted that while food is easier to transmit than non-food items, which are more prone to breaking on impact, logistical challenges abound. “You need to be able to secure the drop-off location,” he says. “It needs to be a large area, free from obstacles and people. Once the cargo is on the ground, there needs to be arrangements in place as regards who will collect it, where it will be stored and how it will be distributed. … We do not do airdrops without these measures in place.”While the ICRC would not comment on the feasibility of humanitarian airdrops in the case of Gaza, the extent of the damage in the densely-populated enclave could undoubtedly pose a challenge. That the area is still an active war zone invites additional hurdles. Schaffner noted that in conflict zones such as South Sudan, where the ICRC conducted airdrops up until 2018, “you … need the agreement of all parties to ensure the operation can take place safely and sometimes deconfliction with military operations is necessary.”It’s for all of these reasons that airdrops are treated as “a matter of last resort,” Schaffner says. “The ICRC only uses them when all other options have failed.” While Alkhatib acknowledges that his proposal would have its challenges, he contends that not all of them are insurmountable. The food, he argues, could be targeted to drop near population centers, just as Jordan did in previous airdrops over its field hospital in the Strip. As for who would collect the goods, he says that rather than relying on already-overwhelmed organizations on the ground such as UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, Gazans could be empowered to collect the food themselves. “Even if some get more bags than others, people will share and people will have a far greater chance of accessing food than to go and line up at distribution centers, wait for hours, and fight with tens of thousands of people just to have any chance of getting a small bag of flour to make bread,” he says. As for ensuring that the operation can take place safely, Alkhatib says that the previous airdrops conducted by France and Jordan prove that reaching such agreements with the Israeli military are possible. Indeed, the Times of Israel reported last month that the Israeli military had established a “deconfliction mechanism” at the U.S.’s request in order to better ensure that humanitarian workers and civilians are protected amid Israeli airstrikes.Securing Israeli cooperation is just one major hurdle that this proposal would need to overcome. Another is convincing critical players—namely the United States, as well as the U.N., the European Union, and key Arab states such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco—to commit to spearheading and financing the effort.Alkhatib is the first to acknowledge that this is not a long-term solution. That can only come from an end to the war and the return of normal flows of food, water, and other necessities into the Gaza Strip, both of which are in Israel’s hands. But as he sees it, countries who are alarmed by the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding are not without agency. And as the scale of the humanitarian crisis worsens, even options of last resort need to be on the table.“I really think the United States could see this as an opportunity to reorient its position and how it is perceived by those who are critical of the U.S. role in the current conflict,” he says. “This could make a difference.” ",

        "body_text": "WASHINGTON — The U.S. and British militaries bombed more than a dozen sites used by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen on Thursday, in a massive retaliatory strike using warship- and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets, U.S. officials said.The U.S. Air Force’s Mideast command said it struck over 60 targets at 16 sites in Yemen, including “command-and-control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities and air defense radar systems.”President Joe Biden said the strikes were meant to demonstrate that the U.S. and its allies “will not tolerate” the militant group’s ceaseless attacks on the Red Sea. And he said they only made the move after attempts at diplomatic negotiations and careful deliberation.“These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea — including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history,” Biden said in a statement. He noted the attacks endangered U.S. personnel and civilian mariners and jeopardized trade, and he added, “I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”Read More: How Congress Is Reacting to Biden’s Military Attack on the Houthis in YemenAssociated Press journalists in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, heard four explosions early Friday local time. Two residents of Hodieda, Amin Ali Saleh and Hani Ahmed, said they heard five strong explosions hitting the western port area of the city, which lies on the Red Sea and is the largest port city controlled by the Houthis. Eyewitnesses who spoke with the AP also said they saw strikes in Taiz and Dhamar, cities south of Sanaa.The strikes marked the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. And the coordinated military assault comes just a week after the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action. The officials described the strikes on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. Members of Congress were briefed earlier Thursday on the strike plans.The warning appeared to have had at least some short-lived impact, as attacks stopped for several days. On Tuesday, however, the Houthi rebels fired their largest-ever barrage of drones and missiles targeting shipping in the Red Sea, with U.S. and British ships and American fighter jets responding by shooting down 18 drones, two cruise missiles and an anti-ship missile. And on Thursday, the Houthis fired an anti-ship ballistic missile into the Gulf of Aden, which was seen by a commercial ship but did not hit the ship.In a call with reporters, senior administration and military officials said that after the Tuesday attacks, Biden convened his national security team and was presented with military options for a response. He then directed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who remains hospitalized with complications from prostate cancer surgery, to carry out the retaliatory strikes.Read More: Lloyd Austin’s Surgery Blunder May Have Compromised National SecurityIn a separate statement, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Royal Air Force carried out targeted strikes against military facilities used by the Houthis. The Defense Ministry said four fighter jets based in Cyprus took part in the strikes.Noting the militants have carried out a series of dangerous attacks on shipping, he added, “This cannot stand.” He said the U.K. took “limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defense, alongside the United States with non-operational support from the Netherlands, Canada and Bahrain against targets tied to these attacks, to degrade Houthi military capabilities and protect global shipping.”The governments of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea joined the U.S. and U.K. in issuing a statement saying that while the aim is to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, the allies won’t hesitate to defend lives and protect commerce in the critical waterway.Russia, however, requested an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the strikes. France, the current council president, said it will take place Friday afternoon.Read More: How—and Why—Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Poised to Seriously Disrupt the Global EconomyThe rebels, who have carried out 27 attacks involving dozens of drones and missiles just since Nov. 19, had warned that any attack by American forces on its sites in Yemen will spark a fierce military response.A high-ranking Houthi official, Ali al-Qahoum, vowed there would be retaliation. “The battle will be bigger … and beyond the imagination and expectation of the Americans and the British,” he said in a post on X.Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, described strikes hitting the Al-Dailami Air Base north of Sanaa, the airport in the port city of the Hodeida, a camp east of Saada, the airport in the city of Taiz and an airport near Hajjah.The Houthis later Friday said the strikes killed five people and wounded six, without elaborating on who the casualties were.A senior administration official said that while the U.S. expects the strikes will degrade the Houthis’ capabilities, “we would not be surprised to see some sort of response,” although they haven't seen anything yet. Officials said the U.S. used warplanes based on the Navy aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and Air Force fighter jets, while the Tomahawk missiles were fired from Navy destroyers and a submarine.Read More: How the U.S.-Led Attacks on Yemen’s Houthis Could Impact Oil PricesThe Houthis say their assaults are aimed at stopping Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But their targets increasingly have little or no connection to Israel and imperil a crucial trade route linking Asia and the Middle East with Europe.Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Wednesday that demanded the Houthis immediately cease the attacks and implicitly condemned their weapons supplier, Iran. It was approved by a vote of 11-0 with four abstentions — by Russia, China, Algeria and Mozambique.Britain’s participation in the strikes underscored the Biden administration’s effort to use a broad international coalition to battle the Houthis, rather than appear to be going it alone. More than 20 nations are already participating in a U.S.-led maritime mission to increase ship protection in the Red Sea.U.S. officials for weeks had declined to signal when international patience would run out and they would strike back at the Houthis, even as multiple commercial vessels were struck by missiles and drones, prompting companies to look at rerouting their ships.Read More: How Attacks in the Red Sea Could Increase Costs of Items from Clothing to CoffeeOn Wednesday, however, U.S. officials again warned of consequences.“I’m not going to telegraph or preview anything that might happen,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters during a stop in Bahrain. He said the U.S. had made clear “that if this continues as it did yesterday, there will be consequences. And I’m going to leave it at that.”The Biden administration’s reluctance over the past several months to retaliate reflected political sensitivities and stemmed largely from broader worries about upending the shaky truce in Yemen and triggering a wider conflict in the region. The White House wants to preserve the truce and has been wary of taking action in Yemen that could open up another war front.The impact on international shipping and the escalating attacks, however, triggered the coalition warning, which was signed by the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom.Read More: What to Know About the U.S. Coalition Force in the Red SeaTransit through the Red Sea, from the Suez Canal to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, is a crucial shipping lane for global commerce. About 12% of the world’s trade typically passes through the waterway that separates Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, including oil, natural gas, grain and everything from toys to electronics.In response to the attacks, the U.S. created a new maritime security mission, dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian, to increase security in the Red Sea, Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden, with about 22 countries participating. U.S. warships, and those from other nations, have been routinely sailing back and forth through the narrow strait to provide protection for ships and to deter attacks. The coalition has also ramped up airborne surveillance.The decision to set up the expanded patrol operation came after three commercial vessels were struck by missiles fired by Houthis in Yemen on Dec. 3.The Pentagon increased its military presence in the region after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel to deter Iran from widening the war into a regional conflict, including by the Houthis and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria.—Associated Press writers Ahmed al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen; Jack Jeffery in London; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations; and Zeke Miller, Aamer Madhani and Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "title_text": "How Congress Is Reacting to Biden’s Military Attack on the Houthis in Yemen",
        "body_text": "The U.S. and U.K.’s coordinated attack Thursday evening on the Iran-backed Houthi rebel—who have been wreaking havoc on international shipping routes in the Red Sea for weeks—has been met by members of Congress with a bipartisan mix of support but also some unease over President Joe Biden’s seemingly unilateral executive action that risks escalating the conflict already raging in the Middle East. The two countries’ militaries targeted Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen in a series of bombings, with Biden warning in a White House statement that he will not hesitate “to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”Read More: Who Are Yemen’s Houthi Rebels? Here’s What You Need to KnowSome senators and representatives on both sides of the aisle have lauded the Biden administration’s decision to operate against the Houthis, while others have expressed concern over lack of congressional oversight. Here are some of the initial reactions from the Capitol so far:I welcome the U.S. and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels. President Biden’s decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue.I am hopeful these operations mark an enduring shift in the Biden Administration’s approach to Iran and its proxies. To restore deterrence and change Iran’s calculus, Iranian leaders themselves must believe that they will pay a meaningful price unless they abandon their worldwide campaign of terror.The United States and our allies must leave no room to doubt that the days of unanswered terrorist aggression are over.The President’s strikes in Yemen are unconstitutional. For over a month, he consulted an international coalition to plan them, but never came to Congress to seek authorization as required by Article I of the Constitution. We need to listen to our Gulf allies, pursue de-escalation, and avoid getting into another Middle East war.Only Congress has the power to declare war. I have to give credit to [Rep. Ro Khanna] here for sticking to his principles, as very few are willing to make this statement while their party is in the White House.This action by U.S. and British forces is long overdue, and we must hope these operations indicate a true shift in the Biden Administration’s approach to Iran and its proxies that are engaging in such evil and wreaking such havoc. They must understand there is a serious price to pay for their global acts of terror and their attacks on U.S. personnel and commercial vessels. America must always project strength, especially in these dangerous times.The decision to strike the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen is necessary to maintain stability and security in the Gulf. The U.S. has dealt with this aggression for far too long, and it is in our nation’s interests to maintain the free flow of commerce. Terrorism has no safe harbor anywhere.The President must come to Congress for permission before going to war.Biden can not solely decide to bomb Yemen. And what is the condition of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin? Is he still laid up in the hospital?Biden [administration] wants to fund war in Ukraine, control the war in Israel, arm Taiwan and prep for war with China, and is now going to war in the Middle East???All with a wide open border, millions invading, and millions of got aways?! This is insanely out of control!This is why I called for a ceasefire early. This is why I voted against war in Iraq. Violence only begets more violence. We need a ceasefire now to prevent deadly, costly, catastrophic escalation of violence in the region.The U.S. must demand an immediate ceasefire. Anything else is just enabling further violence.The strikes against the Yemeni outlaws who have threatened our troops and terrorized international shipping are long overdue. But things should’ve never gotten this far. President Trump wisely designated these rebels as terrorists, while one of Joe Biden’s first acts in office was to reverse that decision. Then President Biden appeased Iran for three years, emboldening not only Iran, but also its proxies in places like Yemen and Gaza. After all, where do a bunch of Yemeni outlaws get the know-how to use cruise missiles and one-way attack drones? Iran. Yet President Biden still can’t even bring himself to mention Iran tonight.We will see if these strikes deter Iran and its proxies from further attacks; I have my doubts. History teaches that only devastating retaliation will deter Iran, as when President Trump killed their terrorist mastermind in 2020 and President Reagan sank half their navy in 1988. That bold, decisive action is the opposite of what we’ve seen from Joe Biden for three years.Tonight’s airstrikes send a clear and decisive message that we will not tolerate terrorism. Despite repeated warnings from the [international] community, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have continued their attacks, impeding the free flow of civilian commerce in the Red Sea.These strikes are necessary, responsive, and proportionate—not escalatory. President Biden is right to act. The Houthi attacks imperil the global economy and increase the risk of a wider war.  Minimizing the risk of a regional conflict is the utmost priority.This is where we should put party aside and stand for the oath we all took: Congress alone decides if we go to war. I join my colleagues on both sides insisting we follow the Constitution.POTUS is violating Article I of the Constitution by carrying out airstrikes in Yemen without congressional approval. The American people are tired of endless war.This strike was two months overdue, but it is a good first step toward restoring deterrence in the Red Sea. I appreciate that the administration took the advice of our regional commanders and targeted critical nodes within Houthi-controlled Yemeni territory. It is important that we follow this action in close consultation with our Saudi partners to ensure they are with us as the situation develops. This strike does not change the basic facts: for weeks, the Houthis have launched drones and missiles at our sailors, while the Biden administration has trumpeted a maritime task force. The Houthi organization, backed by Iran, has for weeks wrought havoc without any significant response.They have disrupted global shipping in a critical commercial sea lane and targeted sophisticated Navy warships. This is having a severe impact on our military and the global economy.It is time to dispense with the hollow talk of “joint resolutions” and “maritime task forces.”This strike should be a warning to the Houthis and other Iranian proxies that they will suffer catastrophic consequences from escalation in the region.I salute the brave military members who carried out today’s strikes, and I support President Biden’s strong actions against the Houthi militants. The Houthis are endangering innocent civilians and launching violent attacks at U.S. personnel.These strikes, in concert with weeks of diplomacy, send a clear signal that the United States will continue to take appropriate action to protect our personnel, our interests, and freedom of navigation for vital international waterways. Even as the Biden Administration continues to take a balanced and sensible diplomatic approach, today’s military actions were necessary and proportional.Tonight’s military action against Yemen is overdue, and we must now maintain pressure on the Iranian-backed Houthis to ensure their lawless behavior is met with severe consequences. The constant attacks on our sailors and on commercial shipping over the past months should have been addressed far earlier. Our response to this malign behavior - which has no purpose other than to sow chaos and disorder at the behest of Iran - must be decisive. It is incumbent upon the President to come to Congress and present the Administration’s strategy for confronting Iran’s reckless behavior across the region.I applaud the brave men and women in uniform who executed this mission and thank our allies and partners.I support the Biden Administration’s targeted strikes against Houthi militant targets within Yemen this evening. I condemn the continued, unprovoked Houthi attacks against commercial shipping and personnel which must immediately cease along with provocative launches and actions against Israel. While I support these targeted, proportional military strikes, I call on the Biden Administration to continue its diplomatic efforts to avoid escalation to a broader regional war and continue to engage Congress on the details of its strategy and legal basis as required by law.Iran and its proxies must understand that repeated attacks on U.S. troops and the disruption of critical sea lanes will not be tolerated. The military strikes taken tonight by the Administration in conjunction with coalition partners is an overdue response to Iranian-backed proxies that have targeted U.S. military personnel, bases, and ships more than 120 times since October, resulting in a gravely injured service member. In addition, the Houthi terrorists have launched dozens of attacks on commercial, non-military ships of multiple countries.The United States does not seek an escalation of violence in the region, but we must deter attacks on our troops, and the freedom of navigation that is essential for global trade must be restored.These airstrikes have NOT been authorized by Congress. The Constitution is clear: Congress has the sole authority to authorize military involvement in overseas conflicts. Every president must first come to Congress and ask for military authorization, regardless of party.The United States cannot risk getting entangled into another decades-long conflict without Congressional authorization. The White House must work with Congress before continuing these airstrikes in Yemen.I would not support us being pulled into a broader war.",

        "body_text": "The U.S. and its allies launched airstrikes on more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen, in retaliation for a spate of attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea.Read More: How—and Why—Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Poised to Seriously Disrupt the Global EconomyThe attack represents a major escalation of tensions in the Middle East that have been simmering since the Hamas attack on Israel in early October. Brent jumped as much as 2.5% on fears there would be more disruption to shipping, and that the conflict could expand into a broader regional conflagration.Read More: How Congress Is Reacting to Biden’s Military Attack on the Houthis in YemenWith the Houthis vowing continued attacks on shipping and Iran condemning the action, here’s what analysts are saying the heightened geopolitical risks mean for oil markets:Oil’s bounce was driven by the market’s perception that this is an escalation of the conflict, said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity strategist at UBS Group AG. However, “any risk premium will only sustain if there are disruptions to oil supply,” he said.“We look for higher prices over the coming months, expecting Brent to move above $80 a barrel, as result of OPEC+ production cuts keeping the oil market slightly undersupplied,” Staunovo said.The U.S. and U.K. airstrikes didn’t come as a surprise, but given the threat faced by vessels and the disruptions to trade flows from Houthi attacks, it’s clearly a ratcheting up of the conflict, according to Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV.That suggests “greater potential for disruptions and the need for vessels to divert,” which will provide upside to oil prices, he said, adding the bigger risk is if the conflict spreads and the market starts seeing threats to flows coming out of the Persian Gulf. “While we believe the risk of this is low, the impact would be significant.”“Quite a bit of the new risk premium has already been priced in,” said Vandana Hari, founder of consultancy Vanda Insights. “We might see crude stacking on another dollar or two... I expect a degree of restraint and back-channel diplomacy to keep the tensions from spiraling out of control and causing a regional conflagration,” she said, as none of the powers involved want the worst-case scenario to play out.“The fluctuations in prices will absolutely remain in place as the situation develops. It’s an uneven tug of war between a bearish outlook on fundamentals and a supportive Mideast risk premium,” Hari said. “As of now, both can be expected to remain in play for the next few months.”“The U.S., U.K. had warned that action would take place if the Houthi rebels continued their attacks, so this action should not really be unexpected,” said Robert Rennie, head of commodity and carbon research at Westpac Banking Corp. Markets have arguably been too focused on rising global supply through the end of 2023, while the sharp deterioration in the situation in the Red Sea has been underplayed so far in 2024, he said. Given that Houthi leaders have said any US attack would not go without a response, West Texas Intermediate could rise above $75 a barrel and Brent could surpass $80.The airstrikes have raised the risk of an escalation and that could bring oil and haven demand in focus in the very near term, said Charu Chanana, market strategist for Saxo Capital Markets Pte.There are upside risks to oil prices if the conflict escalates, and volatility could increase “as oil markets continue to assess the several catalysts from OPEC+ cuts to non-OPEC supply and the US and China demand outlook.”",

        "title_text": "Myanmar’s Military Says It and Ethnic Guerrilla Groups Have Agreed to a Ceasefire",
        "body_text": "BEIJING — Myanmar's military has reached a cease-fire agreement with an alliance of ethnic minority guerrilla groups it has been battling in the country's northeast, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday. Myanmar's military government confirmed the development, as did the ethnic alliance.The agreement was brokered at talks mediated by China on Wednesday and Thursday in Kunming, a Chinese provincial capital about 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the border with Myanmar, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.“China hopes the relevant parties in Myanmar can conscientiously implement the agreement, exercise maximum restraint toward each other and solve the issues through dialogue and consultations,” she said at a daily briefing in Beijing.Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson of Myanmar's ruling military council, said in an audio note to journalists that the two sides had met in Kunming and after talks, agreed on a temporary cease-fire agreement.\"We will continue discussions We will continue to work for the strengthening of the cease-fire,” Zaw Min Tun said.A previous cease-fire pact reached in mid-December was not honored by either side.Chinese spokesperson Mao said the military and the Three Brotherhood Alliance — which comprises the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army — agreed to an immediate cease-fire, the disengaging of military personnel and the settlement of their disputes through negotiations.Read More: Why Southeast Asia Just Can’t Seem to Cut Off Myanmar’s Junta“The two sides promised not to undermine the safety of Chinese people living in the border area and Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar,” she said.The Three Brotherhood Alliance on Friday night issued a statement on the Telegram messaging platform detailing what it called the Haigeng Agreement, apparently named after the Kunming hotel where China has hosted cease-fire talks.It said the cease-fire began Thursday at 9 p.m. local time and committed both sides to avoiding confrontations and employing dialogue to resolve disputes, especially regarding the use of arms.The alliance pledged not to attack encampments and outposts of the military government, which reciprocated by agreeing not to try to launch attacks using artillery and airstrikes, said the statement.However, a separate statement issued by the Ta’ang National Liberation Army said the military on Friday fired heavy weapons into villages in four townships where its guerrillas were operating.Myanmar has been wracked by violence that began after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. The Three Brotherhood Alliance launched an offensive against the military in October and took control of Laukkaing, a key city on the border with China, last week.Their attacks have posed the greatest battlefield challenge to Myanmar’s military rulers since the army takeover.Read More: How a Myanmar Township Defied the Odds to Become a Resistance StrongholdMuch of the fighting is along Myanmar’s border with China, blocking cross-border trade and threatening further political destabilization of Myanmar, a strategic ally of China that is already tangled in civil war in many parts of the country.Independent Myanmar media reports said the cease-fire would not apply to fighting in other parts of the country. The Arakan Army is fighting the military's forces in its home ground in the western state of Rakhine.China is concerned about the rising violence and the safety of Chinese citizens in northern Myanmar, China has also been cracking down on cyberscam operations that have trafficked Chinese workers into Myanmar and forced them to work, including in Laukkaing.The alliance has claimed widespread victories, including the seizure of more than 250 military posts, about a dozen towns and five major border crossing points controlling crucial trade with China.Zaw Min Tun said Myanmar and China will continue to negotiate reopening the border trading gates, which were closed after combat began and most or all of which are now in the hands of the Three Brotherhood Alliance.",

        "title_text": "How a Social Media Spat Spiraled Into an Indian Tourism Boycott of a Tropical Island Paradise",
        "body_text": "The tropical beaches of the tiny archipelagic Maldives may lose one of their biggest tourist groups amid a bizarre diplomatic spat. Here’s everything to know about Indian tourists’ boycott of the Maldives.The row started with a visit Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made to promote domestic tourism to Lakshadweep, an Indian archipelago near the Maldives. The Prime Minister praised the natural beauty of Lakshadweep in a series of posts on X (previously known as Twitter). However, Modi’s visit sparked anger among some officials in the Maldives, which saw the promotion of Lakshadweep as an attempt to divert tourism away from the Maldives.In a reply post to Modi on X, Mariyam Shiuana, a deputy minister in the Muslim-majority country of just about a half million people, called the Indian Prime Minister a “puppet of Israel,” a reference to the close ties between India and the Jewish state amid the controversial Israel-Hamas war. “What a clown,” she wrote in response to a video of Modi walking along a beach in Lakshadweep, tagging her comment with #VisitMaldives.Shiuana’s post has since been deleted, while she and two other officials from the Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Information and Arts were suspended for their remarks. But the damage had already been done: their comments triggered calls in India for a boycott of Maldives that’s spiraling by the day. EaseMyTrip, one of India’s largest online travel platforms, has said that it would no longer be accepting any bookings for the Maldives. Meanwhile, STIC Travel Group—one of the country’s biggest tourism companies—encouraged tour agencies and airlines to steer clear of travel to the Maldives, Bloomberg reported.The diplomatic faux pas has also sparked responses from Bollywood celebrities who are urging Indians to engage in local tourism. Actor Amitabh Bachchan also promoted travel to Lakshadweep in a post on X, while referencing another post by former cricket star Virender Sehwag that called the Maldives officials’ comments “a dig at our country.”On social media, Indians are posting about their canceled trips to the Maldives and urging one another to go to Lakshadweep instead. MakeMyTrip, another Indian travel booking site, reported a 3400% increase in searches for Lakshadweep since Modi’s visit. Indians made up 11% of tourists to the Maldives last year—ranking as the nationality with the largest number of visitors to the tourism hotspot, which relies heavily on the sector to support its small economy. China and India, growing geopolitical rivals that have both historically invested significantly in the Maldives’ development, have long vied for influence over the archipelagic nation due to its strategic location in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The boycott comes as the Maldives’ new President, Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected in September, visited China this week to strengthen diplomatic ties—seemingly at the expense of the Maldives’ relationship with India. (Muizzu’s predecessors were known to reserve India for their first official state visits.)Muizzu, who ran on an anti-India campaign, also asked India to withdraw its troops from the country, where India has provided equipment like radar stations and surveillance aircraft, and deployed about 70 personnel to maintain them. (Muizzu said in December that India had agreed to remove its soldiers from the country, though no timeline has been given for the withdrawal.)The Maldives’ foreign ministry said it was aware of “derogatory remarks” made against foreign leaders on social media. “These opinions are personal and do not represent the views of the Government of Maldives,” the ministry said. The comments by the Maldives officials were also condemned by the Maldives Association of Tourism Industry, which said in a statement that India was one of the country’s “closest neighbors and allies.”“It is our sincere wish that the close relationship between our two nations endures for generations to come and as such, we refrain from actions or speech that may have any negative impact on our good relationship,” the statement said.",

        "title_text": "U.K. Prime Minister Visits Kyiv to Announce More Support for Ukraine in War With Russia",
        "body_text": "KYIV, Ukraine — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak traveled to Kyiv on Friday to unveil a new support package for Ukraine, including an increase in military funding for its war with Russia that after 22 months shows no sign of ending.The 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) in military funding for Ukraine over the next financial year will cover long-range missiles, thousands of drones, air defense, artillery ammunition and maritime security, according to a statement from Sunak's office.Those are some of the items that Kyiv officials have been urging Ukraine’s Western allies to send more of, as the grinding war of attrition brings little change along the front line and both sides turn to long-range strikes.Ukraine and Russia are seeking to replenish their arsenals this year, military analysts say, in anticipation of possible major ground offensives in 2025.“I am here today with one message: the U.K. will also not falter,\" Sunak said. “We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come.”Sunak first visited Ukraine in November 2022, soon after he became prime minister. Britain has been one of Ukraine's most vocal backers.Britain is the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the U.S., giving a total of 4.6 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) in 2022 and 2023.Sunak’s visit came hours after the British and U.S. militaries bombed Yemen, hitting more than a dozen sites used by the Iranian-backed Houthis.Thursday's strikes were a reminder of another war, which has raged for years in the Arab world’s poorest nation. The attack also risked triggering a wider regional conflict over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Those concerns have drawn attention away from Ukraine’s struggle — a shift that Zelenskyy is trying to counter through diplomacy.Both Ukraine and Russia are scrambling to restock their armories. The roughly 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line has been largely static during winter, and both Ukraine and Russia require artillery shells, missiles and drones that enable long-range strikes.Ukraine says Moscow is receiving artillery shells and missiles from North Korea and drones from Iran. On Jan. 4, the White House cited U.S. intelligence officials as saying that Russia acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking them from Iran.Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is pushing Kyiv’s Western allies to provide Ukraine with more support on top of the billions of dollars in military aid the country has already received.This week he visited three small Baltic countries — Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia — in search of new pledges. The eastern European countries, which are also amongst Kyiv’s staunchest supporters, promised more missiles, drones, howitzers and artillery shells.Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine particularly needs air defense systems to fend off Russian aerial barrages. Recent massive Russian barrages — more than 500 drones and missiles were fired between Dec. 29 and Jan. 2, according to officials in Kyiv — are using up Ukraine’s air defense resources and leaving it vulnerable.Sunak said that the U.K. recognizes that Ukrainian security “is our security,” as Kyiv's forces stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion.“Today we are going further — increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new Security Agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term,” he said.Support for Ukraine’s war effort is sputtering. A plan by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to send $60 billion in new funding to Kyiv is being held up in Congress. Europe’s pledge in March to provide 1 million artillery shells within 12 months has also fallen short, with only about 300,000 delivered by the end of last year.",

        "title_text": "What to Know About Taiwan’s New President-Elect Lai Ching-te ",
        "body_text": "Taiwanese Vice President Lai Ching-te won the island democracy’s presidential election on Saturday after his rivals conceded, keeping the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in control for a third term, despite warnings from China over his pro-sovereignty views. But who is Lai Ching-te? Here's what you need to know about his presidential election win and his journey to the leadership role.Lai, 64, secured over 40% of the vote in the three-way race, outpacing his closest rival, Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang, by approximately 7 percentage points, according to Taiwan’s Central Election Commission. Ko Wen-je of the emerging Taiwan People’s Party garnered 26% of the votes. In his victory speech, Lai said that the outcome signified a “victory for the community of democracies” and commended voters for thwarting attempts by “external forces” to influence the election. His election marks the first time in Taiwan's history that a single political party has secured three consecutive terms in office.The geopolitical implications of Lai's victory could prompt Beijing to step up pressure on Taiwan, as China has denounced the island’s ruling party as a separatist force and warned voters that they would be choosing between peace and war in the election. Taiwan’s sovereignty has long been a sensitive issue with its heavily armed, one-state neighbor. The Chinese Communist government has consistently claimed Taiwan as its own territory, despite the island's self-governance and the absence of any historical rule.Read more: Column: Lai Ching-te Won Taiwan’s Presidency, But His Biggest Challenge Lies AheadXi Jinping, the strongman leader of China, has dramatically increased military activity around Taiwan in recent years and emphasized that the issue “should not be passed down generation after generation,” linking it to his mid-century goal of achieving “national rejuvenation.”But the DPP has asserted that Taiwan is not subservient to the Chinese Communist Party, emphasizing that the future of Taiwan should solely be determined by its inhabitants. The majority of the island's 23 million people advocate for maintaining the status quo, avoiding formal declaration of independence or becoming part of China.Lai said in a press conference after he won that he would continue foreign affairs and national defense in line with his predecessor, President Tsai Ing-wen, who cannot run again because of term limits. China cut off most communications with Taiwan after Tsai took office in 2016, turning the Taiwan Strait into one of the most contentious political issues.“Lai's appeal to voters was that he would be Tsai 2.0,” Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei, said via social media after Lai’s rivals conceded. He added that while tensions are unlikely to de-escalate, keeping the status quo plays a crucial role in maintaining stability, as illustrated by the absence of war over the past eight years. “Lai's victory won't lead to conflict, contrary to what many will say. It will lead to more of the same status-quo that we know.”Lai, in response to the election results on Saturday, urged China to understand that “only peace will benefit” both sides. “Global peace and stability depends on peace in the Taiwan Strait,” he said. “We hope that China understands the situation, because China also has a responsibility.”As China signals potential pressure on Taiwan post-election, the Biden Administration has urged Beijing to exercise restraint, fearing an escalation that could strain recent efforts to stabilize U.S.-China relations. The Chinese Defense Ministry has already vowed to \"resolutely crush any form of secessionist designs for ‘Taiwan independence.’”U.S. President Joe Biden delivered a blunt message after Lai’s election Saturday: “We do not support independence” for Taiwan, Biden told reporters.Read more: Taiwan's Lai Ching-te Discusses China, Trade, and More with TIMEA Harvard-educated former physician, who also goes by William, Lai is scheduled to assume office in May. His father died in an accident in the pits when he was just two years old. His mother raised him and his five siblings alone. “One of the biggest assets my father left me was being impoverished,” Lai told TIME in Oct. 2023. “Because in this environment, I worked harder, more vigorously on everything I did. It gave me a sense of determination.”Once a fervent advocate for Taiwanese independence, he has emerged as a pivotal defender of peace in the face of Beijing's assertiveness.His entry into politics began in Tainan, the coastal city in southern Taiwan long associated with strong support for the DPP. Rising from a young legislator to the mayor of Tainan from 2010 to 2017, Lai became a key figure in the party's \"new tide\" faction, advocating at one point for the inclusion of a clause on Taiwan independence in the party charter. He even described himself as a “pragmatic advocate for Taiwan independence” in 2017, after being appointed premier. But during his campaign, Lai emphasized that he does not intend to announce Taiwan’s independence. “Taiwan hopes to be friends with China—we don’t wish to be enemies,” Lai told TIME. “We would welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping to Taiwan and prepare Taiwanese delicacies for him to try.” His success as President will likely hinge on his ability to handle Beijing and prevent a significant crisis in the region. Lai has pledged to continue the policies of President Tsai Ing-wen, emphasizing the significant influence of his predecessor in shaping Taiwan's defense and foreign policy discourse. During the campaign, Lai emphasized his commitment to bolstering Taiwan's global standing through strengthened ties with the U.S. and other democratic allies, rather than pleasing China. His agenda includes continued military reforms, protecting politics from interference, and safeguarding the economy from coercion. But he could face complications. The DPP lost its majority in the legislature, likely limiting Lai's ability to implement his proposed agenda. Moreover, Beijing has been unequivocal in expressing its displeasure with Lai, branding him a “separatist” and “troublemaker” due to his stance on Taiwan's sovereignty and warning of “severe danger” to cross-strait relations if he assumes a prominent role.",

        "title_text": "Thousands of Pro-Palestinian Demonstrators March in Washington, London, and Other Cities",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON — Thousands of demonstrators converged opposite the White House on Saturday to call for an end to Israeli military action in Gaza, while children joined a pro-Palestinian march through central London as part of a global day of action against the longest and deadliest war between Israel and Palestinians in 75 years.People in the U.S. capital held aloft signs questioning President Joe Biden's viability as a presidential candidate because of his staunch support for Israel in the nearly 100-day war against Hamas. Some of the signs read: “No votes for Genocide Joe,” “Biden has blood on his hands\" and “Let Gaza live.”Vendors were also selling South African flags as protesters chanted slogans in support of the country whose accusations of genocide against Israel prompted the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, to take up the case.Dan Devries, a New York resident said he attended the protest because he wants to see a free Gaza, but that he wouldn't vote for either Biden or possible Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.“I see this war as part of the U.S.'s drive to offset its economic decline by engaging in continual war,” said Devries.Washington resident Phil Kline held up a sign calling for Pope Francis to excommunicate Biden.“I know he’s a devout Catholic. Maybe he will take this issue seriously when the pope removes him from the church. There’s no justification for bombing civilians,” Kline said, though he added he still intends to vote for Biden in the November elections.Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of anti-war group CodePink, told The Associated Press that the moniker “Genocide Joe” will stick with Biden for a certain segment of the community because of his handling of the war in Gaza.“I think the Democrats are playing with fire in many ways — playing with fire in that they’re supporting a genocide in Gaza but also playing with fire in terms of their own future,” Benjamin said.Jake and Ida Braford, a young couple from Richmond, Virginia, who brought their two small children to the protest, said they were unsure of whether to vote for Biden in November.“We’re pretty disheartened,” Ida Braford said. “Seeing what is happening in Gaza, and the government’s actions makes me wonder what is our vote worth?”The plight of children in the Gaza Strip was the focus of the latest London march, symbolized by the appearance of Little Amal, a 3.5-meter (11.5-foot) puppet originally meant to highlight the suffering of Syrian refugees.The puppet had become a human rights emblem during an 8,000-kilometer (4,970-mile) journey from the Turkish-Syrian border to Manchester in July 2001.Nearly two-thirds of the 23,843 people killed during Israel’s campaign in Gaza have been women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory.Israel declared war in response to Hamas’ unprecedented cross-border attack on Oct. 7 in which the Islamic militant group killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage. It was the deadliest attack in Israel’s history and the deadliest for Jews since the Holocaust.March organizers had said the Palestinian children would accompany Little Amal through the streets of central London.“On Saturday Amal walks for those most vulnerable and for their bravery and resilience,“ said Amir Nizar Zuabi, artistic director of The Walk Productions. “Amal is a child and a refugee and today in Gaza childhood is under attack, with an unfathomable number of children killed. Childhood itself is being targeted. That’s why we walk.”London’s Metropolitan Police force said some 1,700 officers would be on duty for the march, including many from outside the capital.Home Secretary James Cleverly said he had been briefed by police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley on plans to “ensure order and safety” during the protest.“I back them to use their powers to manage the protest and crack down on any criminality,” Cleverly said.A number of conditions were placed for the march, including a directive that no participant in the protest shall venture near the Israeli Embassy.A pro-Israel rally was set to take place in London on Sunday.The London march was one of several others being held in European cities including Paris, Rome, Milan and Dublin, where thousands also marched along the Irish capital's main thoroughfare to protest Israel’s military operations in the Palestinian enclave.Protesters waved Palestinian flags, held placards critical of the Irish, U.S. and Israeli governments and chanted, “Free, free Palestine.″In Rome, hundreds of demonstrators descended on a boulevard near the famous Colosseum, with some carrying signs reading, “Stop Genocide.”At one point during the protest, amid the din of sound effects mimicking exploding bombs, a number of demonstrators lied down in the street and pulled white sheets over themselves as if they were corpses, while others knelt beside them, their palms daubed in red paint.Many hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Paris’ Republic square to set off on a march calling for an immediate cease-fire, an end to the war, a lifting of the blockade on Gaza and to impose sanctions on Israel. Marching protesters waved the Palestinian flag and held aloft placards and banners reading, “From Gaza to Paris. Resistance.”—Kirka and Hadjicostis reported from London. Associated Press TV producer Francesco Sportelli in Rome and AP writer John Leicester in Paris contributed to this report.",

        "title_text": "Volcano Erupts in Iceland, Forcing Town Evacuation: Here’s What to Know",
        "body_text": "A volcano erupted in southwest Iceland at around 8 a.m. local time. The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) reported that the southernmost part of the fissure was “about 900 m from the town of Grindavík.” The lava flowed towards the fishing town in the Reykjanes peninsula, resulting in a forced evacuation of its residents. The volcanic eruption was triggered after a series of earthquakes struck the region, with the IMO citing that over 200 quakes had been measured in the area. The largest recorded earthquake was of 3.5 magnitude, near Hagafell mountain, just after 4 a.m. local time.A new fissure opened up shortly after midday, local time. Lava spewing from the new fissure entered the outskirts of the town, burning down at least two houses. Footage obtained by the Icelandic national broadcasting service RÚV showed the houses succumbing to the lava.This is the second volcanic eruption to take place in the Reykjanes peninsula in less than one month, and the fifth to occur since 2021. Iceland is home to 32 active volcanoes, making it one of the world's most active volcanic regions.The country sits on the Mid Atlantic Ridge, a divergent boundary, which sees the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate move away from one another. When the plates split, magma rises, and sometimes pushes through to the earth's surface where it erupts as lava.As such, this is the second time the residents of Grindavík have been ordered to evacuate in recent months. They were previously forced to leave their homes in November, after high seismic activity prompted concern that a volcano eruption might occur. The eruption happened in December, when lava spewed from a two-mile-long crack on the Reykjanes peninsula.Since then, authorities have been building defensive walls, with the aim of directing lava away from residential communities in the event of future eruptions. However, the initial opening in the ground was south of the deflection barriers, the IMO stated, confirming that the lava was heading toward the town. But earthquake specialist Benedikt Halldórsson told the RUV that the defensive walls were helping in diverting much of the lava away from the evacuated residential area.In a news address, the Mayor of Grindavík, Fannar Jónasson, commented on the upheaval for residents. \"These are grave events that are now taking place,\" he said. \"These shocks are, of course, very great and serious for the residents... nothing can be done at this stage. We have to wait and see, and hope for the best.\"Iceland President Gudni Johannesson has assured the public there is currently no threat to human life. “A new volcanic eruption began in the early morning, just north of Grindavík,” he said, in a statement shared on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday morning. “The town had already been successfully evacuated overnight and no lives are in danger, although infrastructure may be under threat.” Johannesson added that there are currently no interruptions to flights. This is in stark contrast to a volcanic eruption that occurred in Iceland in 2010, which resulted in thick clouds of ash and heavily impacted travel across Europe's airspace for several weeks.In light of the current eruption, Safe Travel Iceland sent out an alert on Sunday, advising people to steer clear of impacted locations. “The eruption area is closed, including Grindavík, until further notice, and hiking in the area is prohibited. Please respect the closure and stay away from the area.”Meanwhile, the Blue Lagoon—an Icelandic tourist attraction—took the preemptive measure of evacuating all operational units. While the location's official website noted that \"the current eruption site is at a safe distance from Blue Lagoon\" they shared that the area \"will remain closed until Tuesday, Jan. 16.\"Iceland's director of Civil Protection, Vidir Reynisson, issued a warning to the public via the RÚV. \"Unfortunately, as always at the beginning of an eruption, people gather and want to go look at this, but I just think that people must realise the reality of the matter and what is going on. People must, please, give us a break to try to save what is possible to save,\" he urged. \"We have had to spend far too much time turning away civilians, that we could have used for other purposes.\"",

        "title_text": "Denmark’s King Frederik X Takes Throne After Queen Margrethe II Abdicates",
        "body_text": "Denmark ushered in a new era on Sunday as King Frederik X ascended to the throne after his mother, Queen Margrethe II, formally signed her abdication, ending her 52-year reign as Denmark’s longest-serving monarch.The formal transfer of power occurred at a meeting of the Council of State at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, where thousands of people gathered to bid farewell to Margrethe after she became the first Danish monarch in nearly 900 years to voluntarily relinquish the throne. Margrethe, 83, surprised the public when she announced her abdication in a live address on New Year’s Eve, citing a major back surgery she underwent in February last year.“God save the King,” she said on Sunday, after signing the abdication declaration.A cheerful crowd of supporters, many holding miniature Danish flags, filled the route as King Frederik, 55, traveled to the castle in a motorcade, accompanied by the resonating toll of bells from a nearby church. Royal guards conducted their routine daily parade in downtown Copenhagen, donning red jackets in lieu of their customary black attire.Denmark, one of the oldest monarchies across the globe, does not have a coronation ceremony. Instead, the new king and queen made a public appearance on the balcony of the palace, a tradition dating back to the constitution of 1849, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen proclaiming the King’s accession.\"My hope is to become a unifying king of tomorrow,” Frederik X said in his first speech as king, donning a ceremonial military uniform adorned with medals and golden epaulets. “It is a task I have approached all my life. It is a task I take on with pride, respect, and joy.\" Under Denmark tradition, each new sovereign adopts a royal motto as a guiding principle for their reign. Frederik's motto is: \"United, committed, for the kingdom of Denmark.\"The abdication leaves Denmark with two queens, as Queen Margrethe retains her title, and Frederik X’s wife of 19 years, Queen Mary, takes on the role of queen consort. King Frederik X's 18-year-old son, Christian, now assumes the position of Denmark’s crown prince and heir to the throne. Denmark’s monarchy, with its origins tracing back to 10th-century Viking king Gorm the Old, stands as the oldest in Europe and one of the oldest globally. While the royal family's duties are largely ceremonial in the constitutional monarchy, King Frederik X and Queen Mary have been praised for their efforts to modernize the monarchy, even sending their children to state schools.Recent surveys reflect widespread optimism, with 82% of Danes expressing confidence in King Frederik X's ability to perform well in his new role and an even higher percentage, 86%, expressing the same positive outlook for Queen Mary.British Monarch King Charles III, whose coronation in March 2023 drew millions of spectators, congratulated King Frederik on his new role. “My wife joins me in writing to convey our very best wishes on the day of your ascension to the throne of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he said in a statement. “I look forward to working with you on ensuring that the enduring bond between our countries and our families remains strong, and to working together with you on issues which matter so much for our countries and the wider world.”",

        "title_text": "Guatemala President Bernardo Arévalo Inaugurated After Protests Over Delay",
        "body_text": "GUATEMALA CITY — Bernardo Arévalo was sworn in as Guatemala’s president on Monday minutes after midnight despite months of efforts to derail his inauguration, including foot-dragging and rising tensions right up until the transfer of power.Read More: The History That Makes Guatemala’s Presidential Inauguration a Very Big DealArévalo arrives in the presidency after winning August’s elections by a comfortable margin. But nothing has been straightforward since, with Attorney General Consuelo Porras and the establishment forces observers say she represents throwing one legal challenge after another at Arévalo and his party.“It fills me with deep honor to assume this lofty responsibility, showing that our democracy has the necessary strength to resist and that through unity and trust we can change the political panorama in Guatemala,” Arévalo said in his first address as president.Arévalo thanked Guatemala’s youth for not losing hope and the country’s Indigenous peoples for their support, acknowledging “historic debts that we must resolve.” He summarized his administration’s guiding principle as: “There cannot be democracy without social justice and social justice cannot prevail without democracy.”Despite hundreds of Arévalo’s supporters pressuring lawmakers to follow the constitution, even clashing with riot police outside the congress building Sunday, the inauguration process dragged for hours before he took the oath of office just past midnight.A progressive academic-turned-politician and son of a Guatemalan president credited with implementing key social reforms in the mid-20th century, Arévalo takes office with expectations of confronting Guatemala’s entrenched corruption. But it will not be easy.He has little support in congress and Porras’ term as the top law enforcement official extends to 2026, though Arévalo has said one of his first orders of business will be to request her resignation.Supporters had been waiting hours for a festive inauguration celebration in Guatemala City’s emblematic Plaza de la Constitucion and were fed up with yet another delay, sweeping police roughly out of their way before gathering outside congress demanding legislators stop delaying and name the delegation that must attend the ceremony.Congress, which was supposed to attend the inauguration as a special session of the legislature, engaged in bitter infighting over who to recognize as part of the congressional delegation, as members yelled at each other.The leadership commission tasked with doing that was packed with old-guard opponents of Arévalo, and the delay was seen as a tactic to draw out the inauguration and weaken Arévalo.Arévalo wrote in his social media accounts that “they are trying to damage democracy with illegalities, inconsequential details and abuses of power.”Representatives from the U.S. government and Organization of American States called on the congress to respect Guatemala’s constitution.Minutes before midnight, the special session of congress was convened.Porras had tried every legal trick in the book to put Arévalo on trial or in jail before he could take office. And Arévalo’s party won’t have a majority in Congress and may not even have formal recognition there.Arévalo is an academic, diplomat and the son of a progressive president from the middle of the 20th century, and his election marked a political awakening in a population weary of corruption and impunity.“I feel enthusiastic, because we are finally reaching the end of this long and torturous process,” Arévalo said before his inauguration. “Guatemalan society has developed the determination to say ‘no’ to these political-criminal elites.”In his address immediately after his swearing-in, Arévalo said “we will not allow our institutions to submit again to corruption and impunity.” Outgoing President Alejandro Giammattei, widely criticized for eroding the country’s democratic institutions, did not attend the inauguration.But as much as Arévalo wants to change things, he faces enormous obstacles. His anti-corruption stance and outsider status are threats to deep-rooted interests in the Central American country, observers say.Still, the fact he got this far is a testament to international support and condemnation of the myriad attempts to disqualify him.For many Guatemalans, the inauguration represented not only the culmination of Arévalo’s victory at the polls, but also their successful defense of the country’s democracy.In his first act as president, Arévalo visited the site outside the Attorney General’s Office where Indigenous protesters have kept vigil for more than three months, demanding authorities respect the vote and that Porras step down. He applauded them for defending the country’s democracy.It was an important gesture by Arévalo, who was criticized last week for including only one Indigenous person in his Cabinet. In October, hundreds had blocked highways across the country for three weeks to pressure authorities.Indigenous leaders took the opportunity Monday to urge Arévalo not to forget their support and the many basic needs of their communities.Meanwhile, back in the central plaza outside the theater where Arévalo was sworn in, supporters danced and cheered early Monday.“I am very happy,” said Manuel Perez, a 60-year-old retired teacher, as he danced to a band playing salsa music. “I’m here because I’m Guatemalan and I love my country. I hope for a better life for everyone. We’re going to be here celebrating until dawn.”That Arévalo made it to within a day of his inauguration was largely owed to thousands of Guatemala’s Indigenous people, who took to the streets last year to protest and demand that Porras and her prosecutors respect the Aug. 20 vote. Many had called for her resignation, but her term doesn’t end until 2026 and it’s not clear whether Arévalo can rid himself of her.Prosecutors sought to suspend Arévalo’s Seed Movement party — a move that could prevent its legislators from holding leadership positions in Congress — and strip Arévalo of his immunity three times.On Friday, his choice for vice president, Karin Herrera, announced that the Constitutional Court had granted her an injunction heading off a supposed arrest order. She was also sworn in early Monday.Prosecutors have alleged that the Seed Movement engaged in misdeeds in collecting signatures to register as a party years earlier, that its leaders encouraged a monthlong occupation of a public university, and that there was fraud in the election. International observers have denied that.One key was that Arévalo got early and strong support from the international community. The European Union, Organization of American States and the U.S. government repeatedly demanded respect for the popular vote.Washington has gone further, sanctioning Guatemalan officials and private citizens suspected of undermining the country’s democracy.On Thursday, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, Brian A. Nichols, said the aggression toward Arévalo won’t likely stop with his inauguration.",

        "body_text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen’s Houthi rebels fired an anti-ship cruise missile toward an American destroyer in the Red Sea on Sunday, but a U.S. fighter jet shot it down in the latest attack roiling global shipping amid Israel’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, officials said.The attack marks the first U.S.-acknowledged fire by the Houthis since America and allied nations began strikes Friday on the rebels following weeks of assaults on shipping in the Red Sea.The Houthis have targeted that crucial corridor linking Asian and Mideast energy and cargo shipments to the Suez Canal onward to Europe over the Israel-Hamas war, attacks that threaten to widen that conflict into a regional conflagration.Read More: How Congress Is Reacting to Biden’s Military Attack on the Houthis in YemenThe Houthis, a Shiite rebel group allied with Iran that seized Yemen’s capital in 2014, did not immediately acknowledge the attack.It wasn’t immediately clear whether the U.S. would retaliate for the latest attack, though President Joe Biden has said he “will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”The Houthi fire on Sunday went in the direction of the USS Laboon, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer operating in the southern reaches of the Red Sea, the U.S. military’s Central Command said in a statement.The missile came from near Hodeida, a Red Sea port city long held by the Houthis, the U.S. said.“An anti-ship cruise missile was fired from Iranian-backed Houthi militant areas of Yemen toward USS Laboon,” Central Command said. “There were no injuries or damage reported.”The first day of U.S.-led strikes Friday hit 28 locations and struck more than 60 targets with cruise missiles and bombs launched by fighter jets, warships and a submarine. Sites hit included weapon depots, radars and command centers, including in remote mountain areas, the U.S. has said.The Houthis have yet to acknowledge how severe the damage was from the strikes, which they said killed five of their troops and wounded six others.U.S. forces followed up with a strike Saturday on a Houthi radar site.Shipping through the Red Sea has slowed over the attacks. The U.S. Navy on Friday warned American-flagged vessels to steer clear of areas around Yemen in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden for 72 hours after the initial airstrikes.For their part, the Houthis alleged without providing evidence that the U.S. struck a site near Hodeida on Sunday around the same time of the cruise missile fire. The Americans and the United Kingdom did not acknowledge conducting any strike — suggesting the blast may have been from a misfiring Houthi missile.Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.Read More: How—and Why—Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Poised to Seriously Disrupt the Global EconomyThough the Biden administration and its allies have tried to calm tensions in the Middle East for weeks and prevent any wider conflict, the strikes threatened to ignite one.Saudi Arabia, which supports the Yemeni government-in-exile that the Houthis are fighting, sought to distance itself from the attacks on Houthi sites as it tries to maintain a delicate détente with Iran and a cease-fire it has in Yemen. The Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen that began in 2015 has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.The American military did not specifically say the fire targeted the Laboon, following a pattern by the U.S. since the Houthi attacks began. However, U.S. sailors have received combat ribbons for their actions in the Red Sea— something handed out only to those who face active hostilities with an enemy force.—Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo, Lolita C. Baldor in Washington and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.",

        "title_text": "North Korea Claims to Have Tested New Missile With Hypersonic Warhead",
        "body_text": "SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Monday said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead as it pursues more powerful, harder-to-detect weapons designed to strike remote U.S. targets in the region.The report by North Korea’s state media came a day after the South Korean and Japanese militaries detected the launch from a site near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, in what was the North’s first ballistic test of 2024.The launch came two months after North Korea said it successfully tested engines for a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile, which reflected a push to advance its lineup of weapons targeting U.S. military bases in Guam and Japan.Read More: North Korea Keeps Launching Missile Tests. How Worried Should We Be?The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Sunday’s launch was aimed at verifying the reliability of the missile’s solid-fuel engines and the maneuverable flight capabilities of the hypersonic warhead, which the report implied was an upgraded version of previous vehicles designed to perform intermediate-range strikes.The report described the test as a success but didn’t provide details. It didn’t mention whether North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended the test, which it said was part of the country’s regular weapons development activities and did not affect the security of neighbors.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The North’s existing intermediate-range ballistic missiles or IRBMs, including the Hwasong-12 that may be able to reach the U.S. military hub of Guam in the Pacific, are powered by liquid-fuel engines, which are fueled up before launch and cannot stay fueled for long.Missiles with built-in solid propellants can be made ready to launch faster and are easier to move and conceal, theoretically making it harder for adversaries to detect and preempt the launch.The North has since 2021 also been testing hypersonic weapons designed to exceed five times the speed of sound. If perfected, such systems could potentially pose a challenge to regional missile defense systems because of their speed and maneuverability.However, it’s unclear whether the North’s hypersonic vehicles consistently maintained a desired speed exceeding Mach 5 during tests in 2021 and 2022.North Korea’s latest test showed it’s simultaneously trying to advance its hypersonic weapons and develop solid-fuel IRBMs as potential delivery systems, although Sunday’s launch would have been predominantly focused on evaluating the missile’s solid-fuel first-stage, said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Research Institute for National Strategy.“In particular, a hypersonic missile with IRBM-level range would be an effective mean for evading U.S. missile defenses and striking Guam,” Chang said.More flight tests are likely to come soon and raise the alarm of neighbors.North Korea has test-fired its biggest missiles nearly straight up into the air to avoid neighbors’ territory. But the country is more likely to launch the new solid-fuel missile at a normal ballistic trajectory when testing it with a hypersonic warhead in the future, to verify the vehicle’s ability to glide and maneuver at desired speeds following separation from the booster, said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.North Korea has flown the Hwasong-12 IRBMs over Japan three different times since 2017.Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military was analyzing the North’s latest test but declined to elaborate.The South’s Defense Ministry demanded the North halt its ballistic testing activities that violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. It said the South Korean military was maintaining a firm joint defense posture with its U.S. allies and is ready to respond “overwhelmingly” in the event of a direct provocation by the North.Hypersonic weapons were part of a wish-list of sophisticated military assets Kim Jong Un unveiled in 2021, along with multi-warhead missiles, spy satellites, solid-fuel intercontinental range ballistic missiles and submarine-launched nuclear missiles.North Korean military scientists and engineers have been checking off Kim’s list of goals, testing for the first time last year a solid-fuel ICBM Hwasong-18, which added to the North’s arsenal of weapons targeting the U.S. mainland.The North also launched its first military reconnaissance satellite in November and aims to launch three more satellites in 2024, described by Kim as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles.Read More: How the Koreas’ Race to Launch a Spy Satellite Has Ramifications Beyond the PeninsulaTensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years after Kim recently ramped up his weapons demonstrations. The United States and its allies Seoul and Tokyo responded by strengthening their combined military exercises and sharpening their nuclear deterrence strategies.There are also concerns about an alleged arms cooperation between North Korea and Russia as they align in the face of separate, intensifying confrontations with Washington. In their latest sign of diplomacy, a North Korean delegation led by Kim’s foreign minister, Choe Sun Hui, arrived in Moscow on Sunday at the invitation of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, KCNA said. The report didn’t say what would be discussed.The U.S. and South Korean governments have claimed that North Korea has been providing Russia with arms supplies, including artillery and missiles, to help prolong its invasion of Ukraine.The Biden administration said it has evidence that missiles provided by North Korea to Russia had been used in the war in Ukraine. In a joint statement last week, the U.S., South Korea and their partners said the missile transfer supports Russia’s war of aggression and provides North Korea with valuable technical and military insights.Koo Byoungsam, spokesperson of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said Seoul is closely watching Choe’s visit to Russia and lamented that North Korea and Russia were allegedly “maintaining illegal cooperation activities, including arms exchanges” following Kim’s September visit to Russia for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Koo didn’t provide a specific answer when asked whether Choe could be working to set up a Putin visit to North Korea.Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied accusations about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.Some experts say the North could try to dial up pressure in an election year for Seoul and Washington.North Korea earlier this month fired artillery shells near the disputed western sea boundary with South Korea, prompting the South to conduct similar firing in return. Kim has also used a political conference last week to define South Korea as the North’s “principal enemy” and threatened to annihilate it if provoked.—Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to the report.",

        "title_text": "Israeli Soccer Player in Turkey Suspended and Charged Over Hostages Solidarity Expression",
        "body_text": "Turkey has charged an Israeli professional soccer player for the Turkish soccer club Antalyaspor with inciting hatred after he referenced the ongoing Israel-Hamas war during a match in the coastal city of Antalya on Sunday.After scoring a goal against rivals Trabzonspor, Sagiv Jehezkel celebrated by showing to the cameras and crowd his bandaged wrist, which had “100 days,” a small Star of David, and “7.10” written on it—a reference to the number of days that Israeli hostages have been held captive by Hamas since the Palestinian militant group’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Turkish justice minister Yilmaz Tunc said on Sunday that public prosecutors launched an investigation into Jehezkel for “inciting the public to hatred and hostility.”Jehezkel was reportedly detained by police for investigation as he was preparing to leave Turkey on Sunday night, before being released from custody pending trial. He is set to return to Israel with his family on Monday, the Israeli foreign ministry said. “I did not act to incite or provoke anyone. I am not a pro-war person,” Jehezkel was quoted as saying in his statement to the police, Turkish news outlet DHA reported. “I want the war to end. That’s why I showed the message here.”The 28-year-old soccer player, also a member of the Israel national team, joined Antalyaspor in September. The contract he signed then was set to run until June 2026, but the club has said that he is now suspended from the team and may even lose his job altogether.Antalyaspor released a statement on X on Sunday saying that Jehezkel had “acted against the national values ​​of our country” and would be excluded from the team. “Our Board of Directors will never allow behavior against the sensitivities of our country, even if it results in a championship or a cup,” the statement said. Sinan Boztepe, the club’s president, said in a separate statement on X that, while the club considers its players purely as athletes, “without discrimination of religion, language or race,” he did not approve of Jehezkel’s actions. “No one should doubt that I will do what is necessary from now on, just like today,” he wrote. He noted that the club had initially posted about Jehezkel’s goal on social media, but the post was “removed immediately after the issue was noticed.”Boztepe told local media that Jehezkel’s contract would be terminated.Turkey’s national football association also condemned Jehezkel’s behavior, which it described as “completely unacceptable.”Israel’s former Prime Minister Naftali Bennet shared his support for the soccer player. “Shame on you, Turkish government,” he wrote in a post on X. The country’s defense minister Yoav Gallant charged in a post on X that “Turkey serves as the executive arm of Hamas.”Turkey and Israel’s ties have been increasingly strained by the Israel-Hamas war. Jehezkel’s controversial goal celebration on Sunday came as Israelis called for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza that were taken during Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, which killed some 1,100 people. The same day, pro-Palestinian demonstrators across the world marched to protest Israel’s ongoing military operation, which has killed over 22,000 Palestinians. ",

        "title_text": "Taiwan’s Election Isn’t a Disaster for Xi Jinping—Unless He Makes It One",
        "body_text": "Beneath unseasonably clear blue skies on Saturday, the people of Taiwan decided their own future, electing doctor-turned-politician William Lai as their new leader. It was a vote for continuity given Lai represents the same Beijing-skeptic Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as the incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen, but it was also a blunt rejection: a spurning of China’s strong-arm tactics—including diplomatic, economic, and military coercion—that had sought to squeeze the self-ruled island of 23 million in the run-up to the vote.The result sets the stage for a fraught four years to come. While Beijing considers Taiwan its sovereign territory, President-elect Lai insists the island is “already a sovereign, independent country,” as he told TIME in October. This chasm between perspectives has already manifested in spiraling cross-strait ties over the last eight years of DPP government. In 2023, China sent 1,709 warplanes through Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, on top of waging trade embargos, disinformation campaigns, and other coercive measures.As foreign governments and the E.U. congratulated Lai and Taiwan’s young democracy for a clean and fair ballot, Beijing’s sour grapes were on full display, rounding on such pro forma banalities as “interfering with China’s internal affairs.” Special umbrage was reserved for U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who by congratulating a “robust democratic system and electoral process,” Beijing accused of sending “a gravely wrong signal.”The signal that Beijing must send now is that Taiwan’s people have made a mistake. In the months before the vote, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) invested huge effort painting the island’s choice as between peace or war, prosperity or decline, and so to ease pressure now would be to concede the impotence of their bluster. That is not Xi Jinping’s way.“It probably won’t take long for Beijing to register its anger over the result, and its response could be swift and severe,” says Craig Singleton, China program deputy director for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, citing possible intensified military drills, new trade restrictions on Taiwanese companies, and heightened cyberattacks on Taiwanese infrastructure. “Just how far Xi is prepared to go is anyone’s guess.”Yet the result betrays slivers of hope for China—and the opportunity for a more nuanced approach. While Lai won 40.1% of the vote, the main opposition Nationalists (KMT) secured 33.5% and upstart Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) won 26.5%—both by campaigning on restarting dialogue and improving ties with Beijing. (Turnout was a robust 70%.) That means a majority of Taiwan voters disagree with the DPP’s China-skeptic approach but just couldn't agree on the best pro-rapprochement alternative. Had a short-lived pact between the KMT and TPP not spectacularly and embarrassingly blown up in November, then the election result might have been very different.The three-way split also now means Taiwan has a hung legislature, so the DPP must work closely alongside other parties (most likely the TPP) to enact its agenda. Already, pro-DPP media in Taiwan has mellowed considerably on TPP leader Ko Wen-je, who having begun his political career with the DPP had been especially loathed as an apostate. Lai’s domestic agenda hinges on whether the two parties can develop a fruitful working relationship. Defense spending and arms purchases are particularly contentious areas where fissures could appear.And so there’s much to ponder for Wang Huning, China’s top ideologue and a close Xi confidante, who heads up Taiwan policy for the CCP. It won’t be lost on Wang that Lai’s 40% of the vote is the lowest winning margin since 2000. In the future, anti-incumbency and policy paralysis may naturally swing things in the pro-China camp’s favor. “Although the DPP won the presidency, its loss of a majority in the legislature reflects voters’ frustration with the party’s rule after eight years in power,” writes Ben Bland, director of the Asia-Pacific Program at Chatham House, in a briefing note.On the other hand, the election result demonstrates that Taiwan’s citizens are increasingly inured to bullying, although any departure from those tactics would indicate that improved relations are possible under the DPP. From Beijing’s perspective, maintaining economic pressure and diplomatic isolation while offering inducements—educational, cultural, tourism exchanges, for instance—may help improve the Taiwan electorate’s view of China without handing the DPP a free pass.“Eight years of ice-cold relations and pressure towards Taiwan hasn’t really worked out for anybody,” says Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist based in Taiwan for the Australian National University. “Beijing can afford to show a little bit more magnanimity and perhaps consider finally extending the olive branch and thereby stabilizing relations.”Yet such tactics require a certain maturity that the CCP has to date proven itself utterly incapable of mustering. And as the U.S. presidential election approaches in November, support for Taiwan is one of the few issues of bipartisan consensus, with Republicans and Democrats falling over each other to appear the more steadfast. Any stunt similar to then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Taiwan—which Beijing responded to with unprecedented military drills, a naval blockade, and diplomatic freeze—would make any nice guy act impossible to maintain.It hasn’t taken long for Washington to apply its first needle. On Monday, former U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley met with the outgoing Tsai in Taipei’s Presidential Office Building “to reaffirm that the American commitment to Taiwan is rock solid, principled and bipartisan and that the United States stands with its friends”—much to Beijing’s chagrin.  And then looms the question of who might sit in the White House come next January.Following his 2016 election victory, then President-elect Donald Trump broke with decades of official protocol by accepting a congratulatory phone call from Tsai. What the famously transactional frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination might do if he regains power is the potential “black swan event” for cross-strait relations, says Sung. Much rests on Lai’s ability to navigate a tightrope that’s being buffeted by all sides—and Beijing’s willingness not to take the bait of every provocation.“A positive thing is that China is still looking at ways beyond the military to [achieve reunification],” says Jonas Parello-Plesner, executive director of the Alliance of Democracies Foundation, and author of The Battle of Taiwan. “They will, of course, still assess whether there is any possibility for them in the future of getting somebody elected that’s more amenable to China.”",

        "body_text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — The Pacific Island nation of Nauru said Monday that it is switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, a move that reduces the dwindling number of Taiwan’s diplomatic allies to 12 around the world.China claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory and has been peeling off the island’s diplomatic allies, often with promises of development aid. It’s a long-running competition between the two that has swung in China’s favor in recent years.A statement from the government of Nauru said it was severing ties with Taiwan and seeking a resumption of relations with China.“This policy change is a significant first step in moving forward with Nauru’s development,” the statement said.China said it welcomes Nauru’s move to break its “so-called diplomatic ties” with Taiwan.The decision to re-establish ties with China “once again shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends,” a Foreign Ministry statement said.Nauru said in its statement that it would move to the “One China” principle, which holds that Taiwan is part of China and recognizes Beijing as the government of China. It differs from America’s “One China” policy, which recognizes Beijing as China’s government but doesn’t take a position on who rules Taiwan.The announcement was a blow to Taiwan as it took pride in elections held just two days ago, a show of democracy that would not be possible in China. President-elect Lai Ching-te, who will take office in May, has been described as a separatist by China. His Democratic Progressive Party supports maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan has its own government and is not part of China.China says Taiwan must come under its control at some point and has staged frequent military drills around the island to demonstrate its determination.Read More: Taiwan’s Election Isn’t a Disaster for Xi Jinping—Unless He Makes It OneTaiwanese Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of purposefully timing the news to the recent election.“China’s intention is to attack the democracy and freedom that the Taiwanese people are proud of,” Tien said at a news conference.American officials expressed disappointment with the decision. The United States has diplomatic relations with China but also maintains extensive unofficial ties with Taiwan, including selling it fighter jets and other weaponry for its defense.“While the government of Nauru’s action … to sever its diplomatic relationship with Taiwan is a sovereign decision, it is nonetheless a disappointing one,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a written statement.Two retired U.S. officials praised Taiwan’s democratic process in meetings Monday with President Tsai Ing-wen and other leaders. The Biden administration asked the former officials to visit “in their private capacity” since the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.The Nauru announcement caught Jarden Kephas, its ambassador to Taiwan, by surprise.“There’s nothing that I have to say. It was announced by my government and I was told to pack up and go,” he told the AP.Taiwan now has official ties with 11 countries and the Vatican. Seven of the nations are in Latin America and the Caribbean, three are in the Pacific Islands and one is in Africa.—Moritsugu reported from Beijing. Associated Press writer Huizhong Wu in Bangkok contributed to this report.",

        "title_text": "The World Could Soon Have Its First Trillionaire as Inequality Worsens, Oxfam Reports",
        "body_text": "The scourge of global poverty is estimated to take more than 200 years to eradicate, but the rich may reach new heights in just a fraction of that time, with the world on track to see its first-ever trillionaire within a decade, anti-poverty organization Oxfam said in a new report on inequality published Monday. The rise of billionaires, which first emerged in 1916, has already raised concerns about systemic exploitation lurking behind the widening wealth gap; some have argued that there is no such thing as good billionaires. But despite mounting criticism of extreme wealth, the gap between rich and poor has only widened in recent years. Oxfam says the disparity has been “supercharged” since the pandemic. While Covid-19 battered economies and wreaked havoc on job markets—and nearly five billion people worldwide were made poorer since 2020—the world’s five richest people saw their wealth more than double over the same period, according to Oxfam’s report, titled “Inequality Inc.”Oxfam is calling for a “new era of public action” to reduce the gap between regular people and the ultrawealthy, including measures such as breaking up monopolies, tax reform, and strengthening the public sector against corporate power.“We’re witnessing the beginnings of a decade of division, with billions of people shouldering the economic shockwaves of pandemic, inflation and war, while billionaires’ fortunes boom,” Oxfam International’s interim executive director Amitabh Behar said in a press release on Monday. “No corporation or individual should have this much power over our economies and our lives.”",

        "title_text": "At Davos, Conflict, Climate Change, and AI Get Top Billing as Leaders Converge for Elite Meeting",
        "body_text": "DAVOS, Switzerland — The Earth is heating up, as is conflict in the Middle East. The world economy and Ukraine's defense against Russia are sputtering along. Artificial intelligence could upend all our lives.The to-do list of global priorities has grown for this year’s edition of the World Economic Forum gabfest of business, political and other elites in the Alpine snows of Davos, Switzerland. It gets going in earnest Tuesday and runs through Friday.Over 60 heads of state and government, including Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be heading to town to hold both public appearances and closed-door talks. They'll be among more than 2,800 attendees, including academics, artists and international organization leaders.Read More: Davos 2024: Ideas of the YearThe gathering is mostly high-minded ambition — think business innovation, aims for peace-making and security cooperation, or life-changing improvements in health care — and a venue for decision-makers in an array of fields and industries to connect.It is also regularly panned by critics as an emblem of the yawning gap between rich and poor: Young Swiss Socialists staged a rally Sunday to blast the forum and brand attendees as “the richest and most powerful, who are responsible for today’s wars and crises.”“Davos is easily mocked. But in current times it is hard to get people together to talk in a room on shared global issues and the value of face-to-face conversations is very real, as the COVID-19 pandemic showed,\" Bronwen Maddox, director of the Chatham House think tank, said in an email.Here's what to watch for at the annual Davos gathering:MESSY MIDEASTWhile Davos is generally big picture, regional conflict can cast a long shadow — like the war in Ukraine did a year ago, prompting organizers to exclude any Russian delegation.This year, Israel's three-month war with Hamas in Gaza, plus U.S. and British airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen who have fired missiles into Red Sea shipping lanes, are looming large.Herzog, the Israeli president, whose job is more ceremonial than is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's, will be on hand for a Davos session Thursday, and the prime ministers of Qatar, Jordan and Lebanon also will be attending.A “humanitarian briefing on Gaza” session gets a half-hour slot Tuesday.WHITHER AI?A testament to how technology has taken a large and growing slice of attention in Davos, the theme of artificial intelligence “as a driving force for the economy and society” will get about 30 separate sessions.The dizzying emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT over a year ago and rivals since then have elevated the power, promise and portent of artificial intelligence into greater public view. OpenAI chief Sam Altman will be in Davos along with top executives from Microsoft, which helped bankroll his company's rise.AI in education, transparency about the technology, its ethics and impact on creativity are all part of the menu — and the Davos Promenade is swimming in advertisements and displays pointing to the new technology.Forum organizers warned last week that the threat posed by misinformation generated by AI, such as through the creation of synthetic content, is the world's greatest short-term threat.Such misinformation could surge this year, and one session explores the threat of “bots and plots\" on democracies.Forum organizers say elections in countries whose populations together total 4.2 billion people will take place this year, and many will be contested. (Few doubt whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will get a new term.)It comes against the backdrop of talk about a new Cold War, the widening rift between dictatorships — or at least autocracies — and democratic countries.Back-to-back addresses Tuesday by Chinese Premier Li Qiang and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will highlight the contrast. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, gives a speech later in the day.French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak Wednesday, as will Argentina's new president, Javier Milei, a libertarian who has already announced plans to slash the government workforce.Davos corridors were already abuzz about whether former U.S. President Donald Trump — who made two trips to Davos during his term — could be inaugurated again around this time next year following the outcome of November's election.Biden was once a regular at Davos, but has not attended as president.Of all the lofty hopes in Davos, the perennial one of late has been the search for creative and promising ways to fight climate change.This year is no different: Top climate scientists from around the world reported this month that average global temperatures last year obliterated the record highs — raising the urgency level.John Kerry, who is stepping down as Biden's climate adviser, takes part in a panel discussion on a U.S.-backed initiative that aims to draw the private sector into development of low-carbon technologies.Chatham House's Maddox said plans to transition away from fossil fuels agreed during the U.N. climate conference in Dubai last month means climate finance will face a big year in 2024.“Davos is a powerful combination potentially, of a lot of concern about the environment, and a lot of high-powered finance present,” she said.",

        "title_text": "Hamas Says Two More Israeli Hostages Are Dead. Here’s What We Know",
        "body_text": "On Monday, Hamas released a video that it says shows bodies of two Israeli hostages taken Oct. 7—Yossi Sharabi, 53, and Itai Svirsky, 38—claiming that they were killed by Israeli airstrikes. An Israeli military spokesman denied Israel had anything to do with at least one of the deaths, and the Associated Press and New York Times have not been able to verify Hamas's claims or when and where the scenes in the video were filmed. The footage came a day after Hamas released 37-second long video featuring three Israeli hostages. In the video released on Sunday, hostages Noa Argamani, 26, along with Sharabi and Svirsky, state their names and ages to the camera and ask for the war to end and to be returned home to their families, followed by two title cards, one that said “Tomorrow we will inform you of their fate,” and another that said “Your Government is Lying” in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. Earlier in the day, Hamas had said it has lost contact with some hostages and warned that they might have been killed amid Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza. The militant group had also previously threatened to execute hostages in retaliation to Israeli military strikes. Read More: The Families of Israelis Held Hostage by Hamas Speak OutSunday’s video was published exactly 100 days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and marked the beginning of the war in Gaza. At least 23,000 Palestinians have been killed since then. Despite the high civilian death toll of the war, which has led to widespread criticism and a case filed by South Africa in the International Criminal Court of Justice for its “genocidal acts,” Israel has vowed to continue with the war until Hamas has been destroyed.  “We are continuing the war until we are done, until we have a decisive victory, until we achieve all of our goals: the elimination of Hamas, the return of all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address to Israelis marking the 100th day of the war.Some 105 hostages were released following a Qatar-brokered agreement between Israel and Hamas in November. Twenty-one hostages have died since the war began, according to the IDF, including three Israelis who were mistakenly shot dead by Israeli forces while shirtless and waving a makeshift white flag. In a televised statement on Sunday, Hamas spokesperson Abu Obeida blamed the Israeli government for the fate of the hostages remaining in Gaza and said that many had likely been killed during the Israeli bombardment of the Strip. “Most likely, many of them were killed recently, the rest are in great danger every hour and the enemy’s leadership and army bear full responsibility,” he said. Relatives of Israeli hostages have for the most part shied away from criticizing the IDF but have criticiaed the lack of humanitarian assistance or medical care that has gone to the hostages. A group of dozens of relatives of the hostages also protested against the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza last week, attempting to stop some aid trucks from entering the Strip.On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross announced that it would help transfer essential medicines for the first time to those in captivity in the next few days, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office on Saturday.

        "title_text": "Why Iceland’s Volcano Eruption Was a ‘Black Day’ for the Country",
        "body_text": "In the wake of Sunday’s catastrophic eruption in southwestern Icelandic town of Grindavik, a local newspaper has described the natural disaster as a \"black day\" for the Nordic island. Morgunbladid, a daily publication, published the words on their front page alongside an image of burning homes in Grindavik, where at least 3,800 people were evacuated following a number of small earthquakes before the eruption. The comments reflected those made by Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir during a press conference on Sunday: \"Today is a black day for Grindavík and today is a black day for all of Iceland, but the sun will rise again,\" she said, adding that they will deal with this shock together.  Meanwhile, Iceland’s President Gudni Th. Johannesson described the disaster as \"a daunting period of upheaval” for the nation during a televised national address on Sunday evening. A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula erupted before 8 a.m. local time on Sunday, sending molten lava to the fishing town and setting several houses alight. A 450 meter (1,476 ft.) crack emerged in the ground Sunday morning turned into a fissure of about 900 meters (2,953 ft.) by the evening, according to the Meteorological Office. A second fissure opened at around midday and was measured at 100 meters by the evening, the office added. Both fissures have been spewing lava since but less activity has been observed as of Monday. No casualties were reported but displaced individuals—currently placed in the homes of friends, family, or strangers—are awaiting a long-term living solution from the government. So far flights have been interrupted and Keflavik International Airport remains open, but tourist hotspot Bluer Lagoon spa, a short distance from the volcano site, is closed.The lava has already caused major damage and severed the pipes that took hot water from the nearby power station into the town. Homes now have no heat, meaning that it is uninhabitable given freezing temperatures this time of year.The volcanic eruption is Iceland’s fifth in three years, and second in less than a month. An eruption on Dec. 18 saw semi-molten rock projected into the air from a 2.5 miles long crack near Grindavik. Evacuated locals returned to their homes on Dec. 22 when volcanic activity had ceased. Since then, emergency workers have been erecting a 3-meter (9.84-ft.) defensive walls around the town but they were not complete at the time of the second eruption. Jakobsdottir said the barriers were \"serving their purpose\" and had redirected the flow of lava. He added that the new fissure had, however, bypassed these defenses and made its way into the town.Journalist and volcanologist Robin Andrews told the BBC that the effects of the eruption have resulted in “a worst case scenario.\" He told the publication that it could exacerbate health issues for those with respiratory problems. He added, \"What can be said with certainty is that it's an extremely perilous and deleterious situation.\"",

        "title_text": "How Biden Can Stop Houthi Missile Attacks—Without Risking War",
        "body_text": "There is a simple reason why U.S. and U.K. military strikes against Yemen’s Houthis will not achieve their objective of re-opening the crucial Red Sea lanes for international shipping: The Houthis don’t have to succeed in striking additional commercial vessels, or even successfully retaliate against U.S. military ships. All they need to do is to try. That is enough to sustain a de facto shipping blockade of the Red Sea, through which a staggering 12% of global trade flows. Many Western commercial vessels will simply not risk moving their ships through those waters, not in spite of President Joe Biden’s military strikes, but now because of them.The irony is evident as the wealthiest nation in the world bombs one of the poorest. Biden, by escalating tensions with the Iran-backed Houthis, has inadvertently bolstered the militant group’s ability to disrupt international shipping. The Houthis had managed to increase the cost of container shipping in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war by launching missile attacks at cargo ships passing through the vital waterways. But the Biden Administration’s retaliatory strikes on Yemen’s Houthis have turned off shipping companies, perhaps irrevocably, until the war ends. The Houthis have continued to fire missiles at ships almost daily since Thursday. A Houthi missile on Sunday was shot down by the U.S. Navy. It never hit its target, but it still served its purpose: Keeping tensions high and scaring away Western ships heading toward Israel. But even the U.S. ability to continue to shoot down missiles is hardly guaranteed: on Monday, a Houthi missile struck an American-owned container ship in the Gulf of Aden. As such, the Houthis have already succeeded in inflicting a cost onto Israel’s economy, all the while making a mockery of Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s effort to re-establish deterrence.Biden can certainly choose to up the ante and intensify the targeting of Houthi weapons depots and missile launchers. But unless there is a substantial degradation of Houthi military capabilities—a scenario that seems improbable given their large arsenal of anti-ship missiles and estimated 200,000 fighters—continued strikes will only beget more of the same: escalating tensions that strengthen the de facto Houthi blockade and elevate the potential for the conflict to expand into a full-fledged regional war. This is an outcome the Biden Administration claims to want to prevent. It didn't need to reach this point. The Houthis had consistently expressed their demands publicly: an end to attacks on Red Sea ships in exchange for Israel halting strikes on Palestinians in Gaza, which have killed at least 23,000 so far, most of them women and children. There's no guarantee the Houthis would have upheld their commitment post-ceasefire. But when a temporary truce did reign in Gaza from Nov. 24 to 30 of last year, the number of confirmed Houthi attacks in the Red Sea significantly diminished, according to the Institute for the Study of War. (Iraqi militias also completely ceased attacks on U.S. troops during the truce.) The Houthis issued a statement on the last day of the truce, reaffirming their “full readiness to resume its military operations” when fighting resumed in Gaza. Biden ignored this warning. In his last call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Dec. 23, 2023, the U.S. President did not even raise the issue of a ceasefire. Earlier, he had told reporters that there was “no possibility” for a ceasefire. And, of course, his administration vetoed multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for pauses in the fighting. Yet a ceasefire is far more likely to curb Houthi and Iraqi militia attacks; reduce tensions on the Israeli-Lebanese border, where regular exchanges of fire have been taking place; secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas; and, most important of all, stop further civilian casualties in Gaza. Instead, under the guise of restoring deterrence, Biden has done the opposite. If, in the worst-case scenario, Biden’s escalation against the Houthis sparks a regional war, there should be little doubt that this is another war of choice—and one without Congressional authorization. Not because Biden desired it, but because he refused to pursue the most obvious and peaceful path to prevent it.",

        "body_text": "A U.S. owned and operated container ship was struck by an anti-ship ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, U.S. Central Command said in a statement Monday.The strike took place around 4 p.m. local time and hit a vessel named M/V Gibraltar Eagle, which did not incur significant damage and continued its journey. Additionally, the statement said no casualties or injuries resulted from the attack.  U.S. Central Command said that an anti-ship ballistic missile had been fired toward Southern Red Sea commercial shipping lanes earlier that day, at around 2 p.m. local time. The missile failed in flight and impacted on land in Yemen. There were no injuries or damage reported, according to the statement.Reuters reported that three missiles were fired in total, with only one impacting the vessel.Eagle Bulk Shipping, the company that operates the ship, released a statement Monday saying: \"As a result of the impact, the vessel suffered limited damage to a cargo hold but is stable and is heading out of the area.” It added that the vessel was carrying a cargo of steel products and confirmed that all staff on board were uninjured. The attack from the militia group—who are closely aligned with Iran and control the nation's capital Sanaa—comes in response to airstrikes carried out by the U.S. and U.K. on Thursday. The two nations targeted 60 sites across 16 locations.  The Houthis called Thursday’s attack “barbaric” and in a separate statement called the U.K. and the U.S. “legitimate targets.” Speaking of the strikes, U.S. President Joe Biden said they would “not hesitate” to take further action against the Houthis if needed. “These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,” Biden said. On Friday, tens of thousands of Yemenis gathered in several cities to reaffirm their support for Gaza despite the strikes against their nation.Houthis have been targeting and intercepting commercial ships in the Red Sea using drones since Israel began its full-scale bombardment of Gaza in retaliation to Hamas’ surprise attack on Oct. 7. The group has targeted vessels with perceived links to Israel and its allies who have voted against a ceasefire in Gaza, where over 24,000 Palestinians have been killed. The efforts are an attempt to create economic pressure on these nations and disrupt global supply chains, as around 12% of global trade passes through the Red Sea. As a result, some shipping lines have been forced to redirect vessels via longer routes but there have been no casualties as a result of the attacks.",

A démarche is the equivalent of a diplomatic reprimand.“Singaporean leaders stated on multiple occasions that the Taiwan question is ‘a deep red line’ for China,” Mao said on Monday. “China values this statement and hopes that Singapore will strictly abide by the one-China principle and uphold the overall friendly relations between China and Singapore with concrete actions.”Read More: Taiwan’s Election Isn’t a Disaster for Xi Jinping—Unless He Makes It OneThe one-China principle refers to Beijing’s view that there’s only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of it. Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to an emailed request seeking comment. The Southeast Asian country, like most neighbors, has sought to balance deep ties with both China and the U.S. amid a growing geopolitical competition between the two. It has also been vocal in promoting further dialogue in cross-strait relations even though Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has downplayed the likelihood of an imminent conflict over Taiwan. Singapore’s Foreign Ministry in its comments on Sunday touted a “close and longstanding friendship with Taiwan and the Taiwanese people,” as it had in years past, saying it would continue to foster ties based on its “One China” policy. Over the weekend, the self-governing island elected a politician seen as friendly to the U.S., and whom China has branded an “instigator of war.” China said Philippine leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s well wishes to “President-elect Lai” on social media “gravely violate the One China principle.” “China strongly deplores this and firmly opposes this and has immediately lodged strong representations,” Mao said on Tuesday during a regular press briefing. “We would like to tell the Philippines not to play with fire on the Taiwan question.” Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Teresita Daza earlier explained it was the Philippine leader’s way of thanking Taiwan for hosting thousands of overseas Filipino workers, known as OFWs.“The Philippines and Taiwan share mutual interests which include the welfare of nearly 200,000 OFWs in Taiwan,” Daza said. Tensions between China and the Philippines have been escalating over the South China Sea, with their ships clashing in contested waters. Marcos has also strengthened his country’s longstanding defense alliance with the U.S., giving the American military greater access to Philippine facilities including those near Taiwan.",

        "body_text": "China’s is rapidly getting grayer, and amid unsuccessful attempts to boost languishing birth rates, the country has now unveiled plans to reorient a significant part of its massive economy around its aging population.China’s State Council on Monday unveiled a series of measures to promote the “silver economy,” calling on both state-owned and private enterprises to better cater to the elderly and announcing plans to develop 10 industrial parks and increase public and private investments and innovation in elderly products and services. The current silver economy stands at around 7 trillion yuan (US$982 billion), about 6% of China’s total GDP, but it’s projected to grow to 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) by 2035, or about 10% of total GDP by then, according to China National Radio.Latest government statistics released this week show that China’s population aged 60 and above was at about 297 million in 2023, or 21.1% of the overall population, making the country a “super-aged society” by World Bank standards. That demographic is expected to grow to more than half a billion in number by 2050.In its latest policy document, the State Council issued 26 guidelines across four key areas to ensure that all emergent needs of the aging population will be addressed, ranging from smart healthcare to financial planning to “anti-aging,” or the promotion of medical and cosmetic development to combat “geriatric diseases.”It’s the first policy document introduced to specifically address the future needs of a growing aging demographic at the national level, according to state news outlet Global Times. Such plans to boost the silver economy were first mentioned in 2022, when the State Council outlined goals and benchmarks “to mobilize society as a whole to actively respond to population aging.” Absent, however, is any mention of increasing the elderly population’s role in the workforce—which is a recourse other countries with shrinking overall populations are increasingly taking to maintain their national productivity levels. G7 countries are predicted to have 150 million jobs shift to workers aged 55 and up by 2031, according to a Bain & Company analysis.China’s government has previously suggested raising the retirement age gradually, as it currently stands among the lowest in the world at 60 for men, 55 for white-collar women, and 50 for women working in factories.Experts say China’s swiftly exacerbating demographic imbalance, if inadequately addressed, spells disaster for the world’s second largest economy, which is already facing unprecedented youth unemployment and a seemingly intractable real-estate crisis.",

        "body_text": "North Korea has officially dropped peaceful reunification with the South as a key policy goal, according to state reports on Tuesday. In a speech to the Supreme People’s Assembly, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he no longer saw the South as a “partner of reconciliation and reunification,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.The policy shift will see the closure of three government agencies tasked with unification and inter-Korean tourism, namely the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification, the National Economic Cooperation Bureau, and the Mount Kumgang International Tourism Administration. Kim has also reportedly ordered revisions to the North’s constitution, aiming to remove all reference to “peaceful reunification” and “great national unity” from broadcasts, websites, and monuments. “We can specify in our constitution the issue of completely occupying, subjugating and reclaiming the ROK and annexing it as a part of the territory of our ​republic in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula,” Kim said.Although North Korea’s approach to the South has fluctuated widely over decades, at times calling Seoul its main enemy and threatening to “annihilate it” with nuclear weapons, reunification has remained the state's official goal. But the growing economic gap between the North and South as well as rising North-South tensions has further diminished the prospect. On Tuesday, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol described the decision as “anti-national and ahistorical.” The North and South have been engaged in a truce—but not a peace treaty—since the end of the Korean war, which took place from 1950 to 1953. As a result, the two nations have technically remained in a state of war since.  “We don’t want war, but we have no intention of avoiding it,” Kim said.Pyongyang has stepped up its missile tests in recent months amid escalating tensions with Seoul. On Monday, North Korea said it successfully tested its first solid-fuel hypersonic missile, another breakthrough in advanced weaponry. According to a report released last week by 38 North, published by the Washington, D.C.-based Stimson Center think-tank, former state department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecke described current North-South relations as “more dangerous than it has been at any time since early June 1950.”",

        "body_text": "One person was killed and others injured after gunfire broke out involving 20 people trying to cross the border from Egypt to Israel. “A drug smuggling operation south of the Awja Port transporting approximately 174 kilograms of drugs of different types was thwarted, and as a result of an exchange of gunfire resulted in 1 death and 6 arrests,” the Egyptian military said on its Facebook page. Twenty smugglers were reported to be involved in the incident. During the exchange of gunfire, one smuggler was killed and one Israeli soldier had to be taken to the hospital due to her wounds, but she is reported to be in good condition. Drug smuggling occurs periodically on the border between Israel and Egypt. In June 2023, during a similar incident, three Israeli soldiers and an Egyptian border police officer were killed.The Nitzana crossing—where the incident occured—is also where Israel inspects much of the aid that enters the Gaza strip. Egypt and Israel have had a peace treaty since 1979, and the two countries have cooperated in blockading the Gaza strip since Hamas’s takeover in 2007. However, the war in Gaza has strained relations between the two countries, especially as some Israeli officials have called for Egypt to take in Gazan refugees. “It is not the way to deal with the conflict. Palestinian civilians should not be penalized and should not leave their territory,\" Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said at the Aspen Security forum in Washington, D.C. in December. One U.S. official told Axios that ties between the two countries could “rupture” if such a situation occurred. Egyptian and Israeli officials are anxiously monitoring the border, as Arab-Israeli tensions escalate over the war in Gaza and fears of a wider regional conflagration. The U.S. and U.K. last week launched retaliatory strikes against Yemen’s Houthis, who have been firing missiles at shipping containers in the strategic Red Sea. On Monday, Iran fired missiles at what it said was Mossad headquarters in Erbil, Iraq, near the U.S. consulate, killing four civilians. Iraqi officials denied the building was related to Mossad. ",

        "body_text": "JERUSALEM — U.S. Navy SEALs seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry from a ship bound for Yemen's Houthi rebels in a raid last week that saw two of its commandos go missing, the U.S. military said Tuesday.Meanwhile, a new ship came under suspected fire from the Houthis in the Red Sea and sustained some damage, though no one was wounded, officials said.The raid marks the latest seizure by the U.S. Navy and its allies of weapon shipments bound for the rebels, who have launched a series of attacks now threatening global trade in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The seized missile components included types likely used in those attacks.The attacks, U.S.-led retaliatory strikes and the raid all have raised tensions across the wider Middle East, which also saw Iran conduct ballistic missile strikes in both Iraq and Syria.The SEAL raid happened last Thursday, with the commandos launching from the USS Lewis B. Puller backed by drones and helicopters, with the U.S. military's Central Command saying it took place in the Arabian Sea.The SEALs found cruise and ballistic missile components, including propulsion and guidance devices, as well as warheads, Central Command said. It added that air defense parts also were found.“Initial analysis indicates these same weapons have been employed by the Houthis to threaten and attack innocent mariners on international merchant ships transiting in the Red Sea,” Central Command said in a statement.Images released by the U.S. military analyzed by The Associated Press showed components resembling rocket motors and others previously seized. It also included what appeared to be a cruise missile with a small turbojet engine — a type used by the Houthis and Iran.The U.S. Navy ultimately sunk the ship carrying the weapons after deeming it unsafe, Central Command said. The ship's 14 crew have been detained.The Houthis have not acknowledged the seizure and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A United Nations resolution bans arms transfers to Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Tehran has long denied arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran.Meanwhile Tuesday, a missile struck the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. The vessel had been heading north to the Suez Canal when it was attacked, the Greek Shipping and Island Policy Ministry said.The ship — managed by a Greek firm— had no cargo on board and sustained only material damage, the ministry said. The crew included 20 Ukrainians, three Filipinos and one Georgian.Satellite-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed the Zografia still moving after the attack.The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which monitors incidents in the Mideast's waterways, earlier acknowledged an attack in the vicinity of the Zografia.Since November, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.U.S.-led airstrikes targeted Houthi positions on Friday and Saturday. In response, the Houthis launched a missile at a U.S.-owned bulk carrier in the Gulf of Aden, further raising the risks in the conflict.The SEALs traveled in small special operations combat craft driven by naval special warfare crew to get to the boat. As they were boarding it in rough seas, around 8 p.m. local time, one SEAL got knocked off by high waves and a teammate went in after him. Both remain missing.___Associated Press writers Elena Becatoros in Athens, Greece, and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "body_text": "I believe that there are five big, interrelated influences that are driving the changing world order and that they tend to evolve in big cycles. They are:How these five forces work and interact with each other shapes what happens. In this post, I will look at all five of them and their prospects for 2024. As always, the headline points are in bold so you can read this quickly by just scanning them instead of reading the whole thing.  2024 Will Be a Pivotal YearAs explained comprehensively in my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order, there are cause/effect relationships that tend to unfold in big cycles that, like people’s life cycles, can be measured to understand how healthy a country is, where it is in its life cycle, and what its prospects are. I use these measures to provide relatively good estimates of the next 10-year growth rates for 22 countries. I share these numbers periodically and am working on putting them out in the next month or so. This template gives my baseline projections. Then I watch how actual developments unfold relative to expectations.What I will explore today is how actual developments are transpiring relative to the template explained in the book with a focus on 2024. As you will see, the world order is by and large changing according to the template. Within each Big Cycle arc of history, there is a string of years that have events of varying significance in them. While most years fade into insignificance, a few (e.g., 1914, 1917, 1918, 1929, 1933, 1939, 1941, 1944, 1971, 1982, 1989, 1991, 2001, 2008, 2020) stand out. 2024 will likely be one of those years that stands out because all five major forces are approaching or are on the brink of seismic shifts. To clarify, I don’t mean that 2024 will necessarily be a year of seismic shifts that will end democracy in the US and/or take the world over the brink into a war (like 1914, 1929, 1939, 1941, etc.)—I think that there is only a 20% chance of that, which is still too high for comfort. But I do mean that 2024 will almost certainly be a pivotal year in a number of ways—for example, we will find out whether the existing democratic order in the US will or won’t hold up well, and whether or not the world’s international conflicts will be contained. Of course, like all years, 2024 and the events in it will be just small parts of the long string of years and events that make the Big Cycle arc of history, which is what is most important to pay attention to. What follows are my quick thoughts about the status of the five big forces as they will likely affect 2024.  As you might know but is worth repeating, my very conceptual, very macro model for how the world works is that:Of course, that is a very conceptual, macro, and imprecise model that is fleshed out in much greater detail and with much greater precision in my operative decision-making systems.  Let’s now look at these five big forces and where they are in the Big Cycle.  Of course, a lot is happening in many countries that together makes up the whole global picture, and I won’t be able to cover each country in this brief memo. This description of what happened and where we are in these cycles will skew to what happened in the US because it’s most important and because what happened in most other countries was analogous (i.e., the economic weakness due to COVID, how central governments and central banks stimulated to handle it, inflation rates rising, monetary tightenings by central banks, etc.).By my measures, the near-term (one year ahead) riskiness of this force is moderately low when looked at in isolation (i.e., when not considering the other four forces) and is moderately high when considering the effects of the other four forces. More specifically, a) the current market pricing is now roughly in line with the current fundamentals (maybe a bit expensive for US bonds and stocks) and b) I don’t see any really big debt/money/economic problems on the horizon (like in 2008) that can’t be well-managed. At the same time, the internal conflict force in conjunction with the 2024 elections, the external conflict force that will determine how international conflicts unfold, and the climate force that will certainly be costly (but how costly is as unpredictable as the weather) all add risks for markets and economies in 2024. It’s also true that the technology force will evolve a lot in 2024 and will certainly provide a big productivity boost and risks for the economy down the road that will produce great and risky investment opportunities. Looking back over the last five years, we went through one big short-term debt-money-economic cycle that consisted of a big down in markets, economies, and prices that led to a big stimulation (i.e., money and credit expansion) by central governments and central banks. This led to a big swing up in markets, economies, and prices that led to a big tightening that is nearly over as market pricing, inflation, and real growth have been brought to near equilibrium levels. More specifically, this cycle transpired as follows: the big down was caused by the acts of nature force via COVID, which prompted the big stimulation that was executed by central governments sending out a lot of money that produced big deficits and debt sales that were accompanied by central banks printing a lot of money and buying a lot of debt and keeping interest rates artificially low. That enormous amount of government spending—much more than was needed to compensate for the losses of economic activity—occurred for both economic reasons (to offset the economic free fall caused by lockdowns) and political reasons (the election of President Biden and the Democratic Party favored more distributions of money and more spending). This large, monetized fiscal stimulation shifted a lot of wealth to the private sector from the government sector. It is noteworthy that this type of big, coordinated fiscal and monetary policy to get money in the hands of the private sector has happened repeatedly in history during times of extreme distress. I call it Monetary Policy 3 and explained it in depth here. As a result of this stimulation, inflation and growth increased. Also, the international geopolitical influence via international conflicts and the increased emphasis on security rather than cost efficiency further added to inflation. That high inflation led to the rapid tightenings that brought real interest rates from extremely negative to moderately positive and tightened credit. What was surprising about the tightenings is that they didn’t hurt economies as much as was expected. Expectations were based on what happened before and this case was different primarily because the private sector’s incomes and balance sheets were in good shape. So, in 2023 conditions transpired better than what was priced into the markets (i.e., economies stayed stronger and inflation fell faster than the consensus expected), which led to better-than-expected returns for equities, especially for AI-related companies like the seven companies called the “Magnificent Seven,” with attractive returns for cash, nil returns for bonds, and mixed returns for commodities. As for growth, with unemployment relatively low while wage inflation was relatively high, personal earnings were good, which helped the economy withstand the tightening. At the same time, the effects of higher interest rates on interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate, venture capital, and private equity were relatively depressing and included some debt bubbles bursting quietly. Looking back on 2023 with a bottom-up micro perspective, the big, well-financed, new-era disruptor companies (especially AI-related companies) did very well relative to old-era companies that are being disrupted. Earnings expectations for them jumped, as reflected in interest-rate-adjusted PEs jumping. As a result of the MP3 fiscal-monetary policies, private sector balance sheets and cash holdings improved. Additionally, with regard to 2023 inflation, there were better-than-expected adaptations to supply chain disruptions and government-created policies to favor onshoring and nationalism over globalization and low inflation in the goods-producing sectors because of productivity improvements. Also, the previous spikes in commodity prices were followed by downward corrections, which produced commodity deflations that helped to lower the overall inflation rate numbers. Goods inflation was also relatively low and higher interest rates caused price weakness in interest-rate-sensitive items, so real incomes rose despite the tightening.  This short-term debt cycle has thus far lasted nearly five years, is the 13th since the new world order Big Cycle began in 1945, and is unusual because of what caused it (a pandemic) and because of the amounts of coordinated MP3 policies employed by central governments and central banks, which were the largest since World War II. It also followed the classic cyclical steps in that the weakness led to the stimulation, which led to the pickup in growth and inflation, which then led to the tightening, which weakened inflation and growth.Meanwhile, the long-term debt cycle continues to progress toward greater levels of indebtedness (especially government debts), which will eventually be unsustainable and crisis-causing if not rectified. The deteriorations in government finances didn’t have much of a harmful effect because the incremental debt service expenses were heavily absorbed by central governments and central banks, because the faith in the government’s finances was maintained and because the Treasury managed its debt offerings well (e.g., by shortening the maturities of debt sold) to help fit the demand. For reasons I will explain more comprehensively at another time, I expect that if these policies continue to be used as they have been used and as they are projected to be used (i.e., excessive government spending and debt creation accommodated by central bank policies that keep real interest rates low and money and credit plentiful), it will in the long run create big financial problems, but that’s a topic for another time.   The way markets work is that their prices paint a picture of the future that is constantly changing, so changes in the picture of the future lead to changes in prices. For example, one can calculate the expected amount of inflation by comparing inflation-indexed bonds and nominal bonds, and one can bet on it being higher or lower by taking positions in these bonds, knowing that if your estimate is better than others you will make money. The picture that market prices are now painting is for inflation to fall to central banks’ targets, for real growth to be moderate, and for central banks to lower interest rates fairly quickly—so the markets are now reflecting a Goldilocks economy.  As for the economy in 2024, it appears likely that inflation won’t fall as much, growth won’t be as much, and interest rates won’t be cut as much as is reflected in the prices. More specifically, growth will slow, as the cash/savings pile that was built up from the big 2020 and 2021 stimulations is being run down and the interest costs on existing debt will rise as debts mature, which will require debtors to refinance their debts at higher interest rates. As for inflation, if there are no shocks from exogenous forces, I estimate that inflation will probably be about a percent higher than expected. Given that there is a lot of imprecision in my estimates relative to what will actually happen, I don’t have strong bets placed on them. At the same time, 1) internal political conflict forces, 2) external geopolitical conflict forces, and 3) acts of nature provide added downside risks to markets and economies, while 4) the technology force provides very interesting disruptive opportunities. These four forces will affect trade and regulatory policies, economic and military alliances, and the costs of paying for and the disruptions caused by economic and military wars, climate, and a lot more that will affect markets and economies. It appears to me that the biggest risks in 2024 appear to come from the risks of big internal and/or external conflicts. As always, these conflicts will be over money and power, and who wins them will be determined by the amounts of money, power, and smarts the competing sides have to fight these conflicts. Let’s start with the internal conflict force. I see this as the biggest single risk for 2024. A number of countries, most importantly the U.S., are experiencing classic big internal conflicts over wealth, values, and power. The ways these conflicts are happening make it clear that they are in the classic Stage 5 part of the Big Cycle, which is the stage just before civil war (it is explained in detail starting on page 167 in my book). This is when people align on one side or the other and fight intensely for their side or hide from the fight, and few people engage in thoughtful disagreement for the common good. In these times of irreconcilable differences, there is little respect for the existing order of rules and judges, so whether someone is guilty or innocent is judged and sentenced by intensely opinionated people (e.g., ”cancel culture”) rather than an evidence-based justice system. It’s a time when democratic orders are at risk of being disrupted because democracies require people to engage in thoughtful disagreements and follow a system that resolves differences by following rules.  We are seeing this classic Stage 5 dynamic all the time, most recently in the following events:We are also seeing many other classic signs of Stage 5 behaviors such as politicians using their powers to weaken their opponents or even to threaten to jail them; unwavering voting along party lines even when the parties want extreme actions; pervasive lying, distorting, and taking political sides in the media; people moving to places to defend themselves against others who are different whom they feel threatened by; etc. This highly polarized, antagonistic mindset will be carried into the 2024 U.S. elections so it is difficult to imagine that either side will accept losing and subjugate themselves to the policies and values of the other side. Those policies and values are too abhorrent to those on the other side and respect for the rules is too low for those on both sides. I am not saying that we won’t adhere to rules and get through this with our domestic order system intact, but I am saying that it’s difficult to imagine how that will happen. Unfortunately, this internal conflict evolution is transpiring almost exactly as laid out in the template explained in my book. When I published excerpts from the book online in 2020, including the prospect of some form of U.S. civil war, it was considered kooky. Then came the events of January 6, 2021. When I wrote the book, lessons and indicators that I learned from history led me to estimate that the probability of some form of civil war in the U.S. was around 30%. That was considered an unrealistically high estimate. Now it is not. In fact, ~40% of Americans surveyed by YouGov think that it is at least somewhat likely that there will be a civil war in the next decade. I now estimate that the risk of some form of civil war over the next 10 years is about 50%, with 2024 being a high-risk year.    Regardless of what happens in the U.S. elections, the outcomes will have big implications for what will happen in the markets, economies, the domestic order, the world order, geopolitical and economic issues, the handling of the climate, and technology issues because each of the sides has very different views about these issues. The amounts of economic regulation, taxes, immigration, trade agreements, and tariffs as well as social issues will be handled very differently, depending on who is elected. For example, if Donald Trump is elected there is a good chance he would leave NATO, put 10% tariffs on all imports, reduce income and corporate taxes, greatly reduce regulations, reduce green initiatives, pursue much stronger policies of the right, and become more isolationist and nationalistic. If President Biden (or the Democrat who will replace him if the strains of the job impact him) wins, he will pursue diametrically opposed policies. The ideological fight of the extremists is real. If things continue going as they are, voters might eventually be faced with the question, “If forced to choose, would you prefer a fascist or a communist?” In any case, there is no doubt that 2024 will be an important, pivotal year for determining how the domestic order and all that it influences will go.I see this as being a moderately high-risk area in 2024 as the Big Cycle continues to evolve consistent with the template, though there have been some improvements in U.S.-China relations. For reasons explained in my book, there has always been a big cycle from one world war to another in which relative powers and relative authority in setting how the world order works evolve. The dominant power has a dominant say in determining how the world order works until the two leading powers have irreconcilable differences and fight. This typically takes the form of a war that makes clear which country is the dominant power and what the world order will be like. Graham Allison, in his excellent book Destined for War, dealt with the rising power challenging the existing established power part of the cycle very well. Both of us, and many others, agree that a great power conflict between the U.S. and China is now going on. Whether that leads to intense competition or outright war is not yet known. I am staying on top of this closely and must say that the odds keep changing because these two countries are so close to the brink.  The risks of a terrible economic or military war between the U.S. and China rose to a peak last March and have declined significantly over the last 10 months. Last March, I made two visits to China when both the Chinese and American sides were very antagonistic and not talking with each other, and I came away with the belief that there was a dangerously high risk of some sort of very destructive economic or even military war because there were a number of red lines that were close to being crossed and elections in Taiwan and the U.S. in 2024 were likely to intensify the conflict. This is what I wrote then. That very scary possibility of going over the brink led to a desire on both sides to take a big step back, which led to a good meeting between President Biden and President Xi at the APEC conference in San Francisco and follow-up meetings and communications and productive cooperation in a few areas. Still, there is a great power competition that is happening economically and geopolitically all over the world. The battles are for market shares and natural resources and are intensifying as China becomes more competitive (e.g., in solar and wind power generation, electric vehicles, batteries, high-value-added manufacturing, etc.). The resulting change in the world economic order is leading to many traditional producers and markets such as the European ones fading in importance and emerging ones such as India, the ASEAN countries, and the GCC countries rising in importance. Though an oversimplification, as a sweeping generalization, the trend is toward: China and the United States being the leaders in new, exciting, cutting-edge industries and other economies being suppliers of ingredients such as minerals (e.g., Africa and South America), markets for their products (e.g., Europe for Chinese solar and wind energy generation and electric vehicles), emerging markets and producers (like the ASEAN countries), or lesser rising or declining economic powers.You can see China’s emergence as a global competitor by looking at global exports. The table below shows the global export share by product area between the U.S., Europe, and China since 2019. As you can see, in many major product areas China is now a global competitor (and in many cases the global leader)—most notably in industries like automobiles, industrial machinery, and ships. At this point there are only a few areas where China is not yet a major competitor with the U.S. and Europe (aircraft, pharmaceuticals, and services).Since economic, geopolitical, and military powers go together, this intense competition isn’t limited to economics. Though for the time being China doesn’t want to appear to be an overt geopolitical and military competitor, it is certainly becoming a strong one. For example, it is taking a leading role among emerging economies while it is actively involved with them economically. For these reasons, the global economic, geopolitical, and military competitions between the U.S. and China will likely be intense, though probably not violent, in 2024. My read is that they will have conflicts that they talk about and try very hard to work themselves through. While appearing dramatic, these conflicts won’t lead to a terrible conflict. So, while there will be two notable challenges ahead in the form of U.S. and Chinese reactions to last weekend’s Taiwan election and the upcoming U.S. elections this fall, I think that they will probably be handled in a way that won’t produce serious damaging wars, though they might produce some dramatic public displays of power.Of course, the U.S.-China conflict isn’t the only one going on, and since these conflicts are all related, this is getting complicated and risky in many ways that I won’t delve into and admit I don’t fully understand. While we are all aware of the possibility of the Russia-Ukraine war and/or the Israel-Hamas war spreading, I think that there is about a 70% chance that they won’t because all of the large and mid-level power countries, including Israel, Iran, and the GCC countries—like the Americans and the Chinese—don’t want to cross the brink into mutually assured destruction.  For all these reasons, I view the risks of this force as moderately high.  While I’m no expert on climate change, there’s no getting around the reality that as a global macro investor I need to understand enough about it to understand its impacts, so I have studied it. I recently covered what I learned in this study—which, in a nutshell, is that not nearly enough money will be directed to limit global warming to about 1.5°C because it is unprofitable for those who have the money to contribute to or invest in the effort to try to prevent global warming, so there will likely be big impacts from it and big adaptations that will have to be made. In brief, it appears climate change will lead to both bad changes (e.g., droughts and floods, intolerable temperatures that will lead to great migrations of people, rising ocean temperatures and rising sea levels that will inflict great damage, etc.) and good changes (e.g., improved weather and harvests in northern areas such as Canada, the opening up of the Northern Sea Route, etc.), though much more bad, costly things than good things. These changes will lead to more economically motivated investments and spending. That is because those with money will spend more money on adaptations that they need and/or they will invest to take advantage of the increased opportunities to make money from providing these adaptations. So, I expect much more money to go into adapting to climate change than went into preventing it. For example, I expect that there will be great growth in climate-change-related investment funds that are chasing the financial opportunities that will come from climate change adaptations. As for the impact of climate change itself in 2024, I can offer you little more than a trendline extrapolation of what is happening with severe weather events, bumped up for the fact that 2024 will be an El Niño year, which means that it should be considered a risky year. This is the force behind productivity increases that produce rising living standards that are reflected in measures like real GDP and life expectancy.  Productivity increases = inventive, talented people who work well together + financial resources + technologies that further enable them (also known as entrepreneurship). This is the greatest force of humanity and it has never been better. It is fostered by 1) good education, 2) capital markets, including venture capital, private markets, and public markets, and 3) thinking aids like artificial intelligence that are supplementing and turbocharging human intelligence. Turbocharging human intelligence will have big impacts on everything. As mentioned earlier, the effects of artificial intelligence are being reflected in market pricing via improved prospects for profits of those that produce it, and it is certainly the case that 2024 will be a pivotal year for this influence, as there will be much more learning and development during 2024, which will have big productivity-boosting impacts for many years to come. Of course, like all powerful new technologies, this one brings risks of possible harms such as advancing ways people can hurt each other in wars and having technologies replace some people in jobs while boosting the wealth of others. More than anything, how good or bad 2024 will be will depend on how good or bad people are with each other. History shows that all these things can be worked out to produce peace and prosperity if there is smart bipartisanship.",

        "title_text": "Biden Admin Relists Yemen’s Houthi Rebels as ‘Specially Designated Global Terrorists’",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday put Yemen’s Houthi rebels back on its list of specially designated global terrorists, piling financial sanctions on top of American military strikes in the Biden administration’s latest attempt to stop the militants’ attacks on global shipping. But a new Houthi attack on an American-owned ship was reported.Biden administration officials said they would design the financial penalties on the Houthis to minimize harm to Yemen's 32 million people, who are among the world’s poorest and hungriest after years of war between the Iran-backed Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition.But aid officials expressed concern. The decision would only add “another level of uncertainty and threat for Yemenis still caught in one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises,” Oxfam America associate director Scott Paul said.The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing.President Donald Trump’s administration designated the Houthis as global terrorists and a foreign terrorist organization in one of his last acts in office. President Joe Biden reversed course early on, at the time citing the humanitarian threat that the sanctions posed to ordinary Yemenis.Read More: For Antony Blinken, the War in Gaza Is a Test of U.S. PowerMilitary strikes by the U.S. and Britain against Houthi targets in Yemen have failed to stop weeks of drone, rocket and missile strikes by Houthi forces on commercial shipping transiting the Red Sea route, which borders Yemen.The Houthis are one in a network of Iran- and Hamas-allied militant groups around the Middle East that have escalated attacks on Israel, the U.S. and others since Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.The Houthis were originally a clan-based rebel movement. They seized Yemen’s capital in 2014 and withstood a subsequent yearslong invasion led by Saudi Arabia aimed at driving the Houthis from power. Two-thirds of Yemen's people live in territory now controlled by the Houthis.Even as administration officials previewed the new sanctions, Houthis launched the second attack this week against an American-owned ship, striking with a bomb-carrying drone. The vessel and crew were safe after extinguishing a fire from the attack, the captain reported.Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdul-Salam, meanwhile, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the militant group considered its new terrorist designation by the U.S. to be “a badge of honor for Yemen for its support of Palestinian resistance in Gaza.”Read More: How—and Why—Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Poised to Seriously Disrupt the Global EconomyCritics say the additional broad U.S. sanctions may have little effect on the Houthis, a defiant and relatively isolated group with few known assets in the U.S. to be threatened. There is also concern that designating the Houthis as terrorists may complicate international attempts to broker a peace deal in the now-subsided war with Saudi Arabia.War and chronic misgovernment have left 24 million Yemenis at risk of hunger and disease, and roughly 14 million are in acute need of humanitarian assistance, the United Nations says. Aid groups during the height of Yemen's war issued repeated warnings that millions of Yemenis were on the brink of famine.Aid organizations worry that just the fear of running afoul of U.S. regulations could be enough to scare away shippers, banks and others in the commercial supply chain that Yemenis depend upon for survival. Yemen imports 90% of its food.U.S. officials said the sanctions would exempt commercial shipments of food, medicine and fuel, and humanitarian assistance into Yemeni ports. The U.S. will wait 30 days to put the sanctions into effect, officials said, giving shipping companies, banks, insurers and others time to prepare.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement that the U.S. would roll out “unprecedented\" exemptions in the sanctions for staples including food to “help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni people,” adding that they “should not pay the price for the actions of the Houthis.”Read More: History Suggests U.S. Airstrikes Against the Houthis Will BackfireThe administration, for now, is not reimposing the more severe designation of foreign terrorist organization on the Houthis. That would have barred Americans, along with people and organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, from providing “material support” to the Houthis. Aid groups said that step could have the effect of criminalizing ordinary trade and assistance to Yemenis.The U.S will reevaluate the designation if the Houthis comply, Sullivan said.Jared Rowell, the Yemen country director for the International Rescue Committee, said last week that the attacks and counterattacks already were interrupting the delivery of goods and aid into Yemen, delaying shipments of vital commodities and raising prices for food and fuel.Conservatives have pressed for the foreign terrorist designation to be reimposed ever since the Biden administration lifted it.Republican Rep, Michel McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cited the series of Houthi attacks as he condemned the White House’s decision not to reimpose that tougher designation, which carries more sweeping penalties.Read More: How Congress Is Reacting to Biden’s Military Attack on the Houthis in YemenWhen Biden was asked last week whether the Houthis were a terrorist group, he replied, “I think they are.”Hisham Al-Omeisy, a Yemeni analyst living in the Washington, area, said the U.S. designation plays into the Houthis’ narrative to the world that they are standing up to a superpower to champion Muslims everywhere.At home, the designation helps the Houthis’ message to Yemenis that the U.S. is the cause of their suffering, Al-Omeisy said.In the past, he said, the Houthis were angered that “the U.S. was basically treating them as a bug on the windshield.”Now, “they’re like, ‘You know what, they respect us,’” he said of the Houthis' attitude. “‘Yeah, we can go toe to toe with the Americans, right?’”It's not clear if any U.S. partners are working on similar sanctions.European Commission spokesman Peter Stano declined to comment on whether sanctions are being discussed.—Associated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is expected to soon announce plans to redesignate Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen as specially designated global terrorists, according to two people familiar with the White House decision and a U.S. official.The move comes as the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The group says it has attacked the ships in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.The three people familiar with the decision were not authorized to comment and requested anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of the expected formal announcement.Secretary of State Antony Blinken delisted the Houthis as both a foreign terrorist organization and as specially designated global terrorists in February 2021 as the administration sought to make it easier to get food imports and humanitarian aid into Yemen.Read More: For Antony Blinken, the War in Gaza Is a Test of U.S. PowerIn its waning days, the Trump administration designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization over the strong objections of human rights and humanitarian aid groups.The foreign terrorist designation barred Americans and people and organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction from providing “material support” to the Houthis, which the groups said would result in an even greater humanitarian catastrophe than what was already happening in Yemen.Shortly after the Biden administration took office, Blinken removed the designations in a step that was roundly criticized by conservative lawmakers and others but was intended to keep much-needed food, medicine and other aid flowing to Yemen.Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula bordering the Red Sea, is the poorest country in the Arab world. War and chronic misgovernment have left 24 million Yemenis at risk of hunger and disease as of 2023, and roughly 14 million in acute need of assistance, the United Nations says. About two-thirds of Yemenis live in territory controlled by the Houthis.While supporters of broad sanctions argue it’s possible to shape any enforcement mechanisms so to exempt food and humanitarian aid, aid organizations worry that fears of running afoul of U.S. regulation could scare away shippers, banks and other players vital to Yemen’s commercial food supply. Arid Yemen imports 90% of its food.“This designation would add another level of uncertainty and threat for Yemenis still caught in one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises,” said Scott Paul, an associate director of Oxfam America. “The Biden administration is playing with fire and we call on them to avoid this designation immediately and prioritize the lives of Yemenis now.”The specially designated global terrorists label to be reimposed on the Houthis does not include sanctions for providing “material support” and it does not come with travel bans that are also imposed with the foreign terrorist organization label, steps intended to help prevent the U.S. move from harming ordinary Yemenis.Meanwhile, a senior White House official said Tuesday that addressing the ongoing threat by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on commercial vessels in the Red Sea is an “all hands on deck” problem that the U.S. and allies must address together to minimize impact on the global economy.Read More: How—and Why—Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Poised to Seriously Disrupt the Global Economy“How long this goes on and how bad it gets comes down not just to the decisions of the countries in the coalition that took strikes last week,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The Iran-backed Houthi group has launched dozens of attacks since November on vessels in the Red Sea, a vital corridor for the world’s shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians in the war with Israel. U.S. and British forces have responded by carrying out dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen since Friday. The attacks by the Houthis have continued.Linda Thomas Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said last week that 2,000 ships since November have been forced to divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea. Houthi militants have threatened or taken hostage mariners from more than 20 countries.The Red Sea attacks have already caused significant disruptions to global trade. Oil prices have edged higher in recent days, though Brent crude futures were down slightly in early trading Tuesday.Read More: How the U.S.-Led Attacks on Yemen’s Houthis Could Impact Oil PricesThe U.S. launched a new strike against the Houthis on Tuesday, hitting anti-ship missiles in the third assault on the Iranian-backed group in recent days. The strike came as the Iranian-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile attack against the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. No one was injured.Sullivan said it was critical that countries with influence on Tehran and other Middle East capitals make it clear “that the entire world rejects wholesale the idea that a group like the Houthis can basically hijack the world.”President Joe Biden's senior adviser acknowledged that the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea as well as groups allied to Iran carrying out attacks in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen pose concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could escalate even as Israeli officials have indicated a shift in intensity in their military campaign.“We have to guard against and be vigilant against the possibility that in fact, rather than heading towards de-escalation, we are on a path of escalation that we have to manage,” Sullivan said.The comments from Sullivan came after Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said during an appearance at the Davos forum that the situation in the Middle East is a “recipe for escalation everywhere.” He said Qatar believes that ending the conflict in Gaza will stop the Houthis and militant groups from launching attacks elsewhere in the region.Sullivan on Tuesday met with Al Thani as well as Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Iraqi Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani, according to the White House.Iran fired missiles late Monday at what it said were Israeli “spy headquarters” in an upscale neighborhood near the sprawling U.S. Consulate compound in Irbil, the seat of Iraq’s northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and at targets linked to the extremist Islamic State group in northern Syria.Iraq on Tuesday called the attacks, which killed several civilians, a “blatant violation” of Iraq’s sovereignty and recalled its ambassador from Tehran.—Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Jerusalem, Edith M.

But residents are growing increasingly stressed out, with physical and mental health deteriorating in recent years amid social unrest and the pandemic. In a recent survey from insurance provider Cigna Group, Hong Kong residents reported the lowest levels of physical, mental, social and occupational wellbeing among 12 markets including the U.S., U.K., mainland China and Singapore. Top stressors in the city included its high cost of living and uncertainty about the future. The city’s death rate from Covid was at one point the highest in the world. The elderly were particularly hit by the coronavirus, partly due to higher-density living situations and lower vaccination rates.",

        "body_text": "China’s population contracted for the second straight year—as deaths in 2023 rose and births hit a new low—as the world’s second largest economy faces growing risk of demographic crisis.Government data released Wednesday showed that China’s overall population by the end of 2023 was 1.4097 billion, down about 2 million people from 1.4118 billion in 2022, which last year fell for the first time in decades by about 850,000 from 2021. The year-to-year decrease may seem relatively minute, but experts say it represents a significant trend for the country and a major threat to its plans for growth.China’s birth rate last year stood at 6.39 per thousand, down from 6.77 per thousand in 2022, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, as high costs of childrearing and record-levels of youth unemployment appear to be leading to an increasing aversion to having kids.Read More: China Is Desperate to Boost Its Low Birth Rates. It May Have to Accept the New NormalMeanwhile, China experienced 11.1 million deaths in 2023, up from 10.4 million in 2022. Observers anticipated such an uptick as China abruptly lifted its strict COVID-19 controls in late 2022.China’s official population counts exclude foreigners as well as residents of its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau.Notably, the demographic data released on Wednesday also showed that the proportion of China’s population aged 60 and above has surpassed 20%. Earlier this week, in an effort to address the challenges of an aging population, China unveiled a plan to boost its “silver economy.”",

        "title_text": "Pakistan Can Keep Imran Khan Out of Power, but It Can’t Keep His Popularity Down",
        "body_text": "It’s not been a great couple of years for Pakistan’s Imran Khan. Since his ouster as Prime Minister in an April 2022 no-confidence vote, the cricketer-turned-politician has been shot, hit with over 180 charges ranging from rioting to terrorism, and jailed in a fetid nine-by-11-foot cell following an Aug. 5 corruption conviction for allegedly selling state gifts. As Pakistan approaches fresh elections on Feb. 8, the 71-year-old’s chances of a comeback appear gossamer thin, despite retaining broad public support.Pakistan’s military kingmakers are using every trick at their disposal to sideline the nation’s most popular politician and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Over recent months, thousands of PTI workers have been arrested, dozens of party leaders resigned following lengthy interrogations, Khan’s name was banned from mainstream media, and constituency boundary lines were redrawn to allegedly benefit his opponents. Khan’s own nomination papers have also been rejected.“Elections are being held but I’ve got serious doubts whether real democracy or democratic principles are being followed,” says Samina Yasmeen, director of the Centre for Muslim States and Societies at the University of Western Australia.And now Khan won’t even have his cricket bat.On Monday, Khan’s PTI party was banned from using its iconic cricket bat logo on ballot papers, significantly hampering its chances amongst an electorate which is up to 40% illiterate. Most crucially, it effectively bans the PTI as a party and means its candidates will likely have to stand as independents, who will reportedly use a range of symbols ranging from a rollercoaster to a goat. “The election symbol is an integral component of fair elections,” Raoof Hasan, PTI’s principal spokesman and a former special assistant to Khan, tells TIME. “It’s rendering the party toothless.”Pakistani lawmakers are constitutionally obliged to vote along party lines for certain key matters, including the leader of the house and financial legislation. But if PTI-backed candidates are officially independents, they are under no such constraints, making it much easier for the opposition to cobble together a coalition by targeting individuals with inducements. Additionally, PTI will be ineligible to receive its rightful proportion of the 200-odd parliamentary “reserved seats” for women and minorities that are allocated according to a party’s proportion of the overall vote, which would instead be divvied out to the other registered parties.Then again, even registering as independents has not been easy for the PTI. Each candidate must file their nomination in the constituency where they intend to stand, but PTI’s candidates frequently find their nomination papers snatched from their hands by shadowy security personnel. To avoid this, the PTI has taken to dispatching several candidates with nomination papers in the hope that one might break through the security cordon.But even if one does manage to submit papers, each candidate requires a proposer and seconder to attend the nomination in person. On many occasions, a PTI candidate has presented his papers only to find either or both has abruptly been “kidnapped,” says Hasan, meaning that an alleged 90% of its candidates’ nomination papers have been rejected. “This is massive pre-poll rigging.”The hurdles facing Khan and PTI stand in stark contrast to the lot dealt to Nawaz Sharif, three-time former Prime Minister, who was most recently ousted for corruption in 2017 and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. In 2018, Sharif traveled to London on bail for medical treatment but absconded and remained a fugitive in exile. But on Oct. 21, an apparently healthy Sharif returned to Pakistan, where his corruption conviction was swiftly quashed and last week his lifetime ban from politics also overturned. On Monday, Sharif, 74, launched his campaign to return as Prime Minister for a fourth time—much to the chagrin of disenfranchised PTI supporters.“The temperature is going to rise in the next few weeks when candidates step out to do rallies,” Khan’s sister, Aleema, tells TIME. “There’s going to be anger on the streets.”It’s no secret that Pakistan’s military kingmakers have thrown their support behind Sharif, which ultimately means he’s a shoo-in to return to power. But Khan’s enduring popularity means more heavy-handed tactics will be required. Despite all PTI’s headwinds, and extremely patchy governance record while in power, a Gallup opinion poll from December shows the imprisoned Khan’s approval ratings stand at 57%, compared to 52% for Sharif. PTI remains confident that they will win if allowed to compete in a fair fight.“People, especially at the grassroot level, are very pro-Imran Khan,” says Yasmeen. “Even if he tells them to vote for a piece of furniture, it will be elected.”A big question is why the international community has been so muted in the face of such brazen irregularities—especially the U.S., which under the Joe Biden administration claims to have made democracy promotion a key foreign policy priority. The stakes are high; nuclear-armed Pakistan is drowning in $140 billion of external debt, while ordinary people are battling with Asia’s highest inflation, with food prices rising 38.5% year-on-year.The truth is that Khan has few friends in the West after prioritizing relations with Russia and China. “From a Washington perspective, anyone would be better than Khan,” says Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.Sharif, by contrast, is perceived as business-friendly and pro-America. Following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Washington’s foreign policy priorities have shifted to China, Ukraine, and now Gaza. Yet the importance of a trusted partner in Islamabad was made plain this week following an Iranian airstrike on alleged Sunni militants in Pakistan territory that killed at least two children and threatens a further escalation of the violence already roiling the Middle East.American priorities in Pakistan are keeping a lid on terrorism and stabilizing relations with arch-nemesis India—and Sharif has a better record on both. However, these priorities aren’t necessarily shared by Pakistan’s military overlords, who may be backing Sharif today but have engineered his ouster thrice in the past—once via a coup d’état. There remains “a lot of bad blood between Nawaz and the military,” says Kugelman, “even if he were to become the next Prime Minister, civil-military relations could take the same turn for the worse.”After all, no Pakistan Prime Minister has ever completed a full term—and if Sharif gets back in, few would bet on him becoming the first at the fourth time of asking. It may be part of the reason why Khan has adopted a stoic disposition despite the deprivations of his prison cell. “He is cold in jail but quite happy,” says Aleema Khan. “He’s read so many books, maybe two to three every day, and he’s very content to have this retreat time—spiritually, mentally, and physically, he says he feels better.”Perhaps content in the knowledge that, while February’s election may be beyond hope, in Pakistan you may be down, but you’re never truly out. And that’s all the more reason to keep fighting. “We shall be in the election,” says Hasan. “We’re not going to back off, we’re not going to walk away, we’re not going to forfeit even a single seat throughout the country.”",

        "title_text": "Here’s How China Has Responded to Countries Congratulating Taiwan’s Election Winner",
        "body_text": "As global congratulations have poured in for Taiwan’s Lai Ching-te, also known as William Lai, after the Democratic Progressive Party’s presidential candidate emerged victorious in pivotal elections on Saturday, one unsurprising country is making its displeasure very clear.China, which claims the self-governed island of Taiwan as part of its territory and insists that it will be brought under Beijing’s control, has long voiced its opposition to the pro-independence DPP and viewed Lai and his running mate Hsiao Bi-khim with deep apprehension and mistrust. Now, China is rebuking any nation that dares to pay respect to Lai for his victory—or even to Taiwan for its successful democratic process.Read More: Taiwan’s Election Isn’t a Disaster for Xi—Unless He Makes It OneHere are some of the countries that have found themselves in the crosshairs of Beijing and on the receiving end of stern diplomatic warnings. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent Lai a message of congratulations shortly after his election victory on Saturday, in a statement that emphasized the U.S.’s commitment to “maintaining cross-Strait peace and stability.” Blinken added that he looked forward to furthering “our longstanding unofficial relationship, consistent with the U.S. one China policy,” referring to the ambiguous principle observed by numerous countries that there is only to be recognized one sovereign nation of China, the People’s Republic, which Beijing asserts Taiwan is a part of. The Chinese foreign ministry said in response that the U.S. was sending a “gravely wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces.” “We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this, and have made serious representations to the U.S. side,” the ministry said on Sunday. “The Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations.”China’s criticism, however, has not deterred the U.S., which sent an unofficial delegation of former federal officials to Taipei this week to convey their congratulations. Though the officials were said to be traveling there “in their private capacity,” during the visit, former U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley told outgoing Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, also of the DPP, on Monday that the U.S. commitment to the self-governed island was “rock solid.”British Foreign Secretary David Cameron offered “warm congratulations” to Taiwan in a statement on Saturday after the Taiwanese election results were clear. “I hope that the 2 sides of the Taiwan Strait will renew efforts to resolve differences peacefully through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion,” he added.The Chinese embassy in the U.K. swiftly condemned what it described as a “wrong act” by Cameron, and an embassy spokesperson urged the U.K. to “refrain from any words or actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs.”Australia’s foreign ministry published a statement on Sunday congratulating Lai’s victory. “The smooth conduct of the elections is a testament to the maturity and strength of Taiwan's democracy,” the statement said. “Australia looks forward to continuing to work with Taiwan to advance our important trade and investment relationship, as well as our deep and longstanding educational, scientific, cultural and people-to-people ties.”In response, China on Wednesday made “serious representations” to Australia for its congratulations of Lai’s election victory, China’s ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian said during a press conference at the Chinese embassy in Canberra.“This is a very sensitive issue to our bilateral relationship,” Xiao told reporters, adding that China had communicated to Australia its disapproval over the statement on what it described as “China’s local provincial elections.”“On the question of Taiwan, there is no room at all for us to show flexibility or to make compromise,” Xiao said, adding that he was seeking to speak about the matter further with Australian diplomats in the coming days. Japan’s foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa congratulated Lai on Sunday in a statement that described Taiwan as “an extremely crucial partner and an important friend.”“We expect that the issue surrounding Taiwan will be resolved peacefully through dialogue, thereby contributing to the peace and stability in the region,” Kamikawa said.That same day, the Chinese embassy in Japan released a statement calling Kamikawa’s comments “serious interference in China's internal affairs.” The embassy said that it had lodged serious representations with the Japanese side and urged Japan to “avoid sending wrong signals to ‘Taiwan independence’ forces and disrupting stability in both the Taiwan strait and China-Japan relations.”“Singapore shares a close and longstanding friendship with Taiwan and the Taiwanese people, and will continue to grow this relationship based on our ‘One China’ policy,” Singapore’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Despite the message emphasizing the One China policy, Beijing was still not happy.China made “solemn démarches”—the diplomatic version of a reprimand—to the Southeast Asian country, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a press conference on Monday. “Singaporean leaders stated on multiple occasions that the Taiwan question is ‘a deep red line’ for China,” Mao said. “China values this statement and hopes that Singapore will strictly abide by the one-China principle and uphold the overall friendly relations between China and Singapore with concrete actions.”On Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. congratulated Lai in a post on X that noted “close collaboration” and “mutual interests” between Taiwan and the Philippines—just one day after its foreign ministry issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to the one-China policy.In response to a question about Marcos’ post, Mao said at a press conference on Tuesday that China “strongly deplores and firmly opposes” Marcos Jr.’s remarks and has “immediately lodged strong representations to the Philippine side.”“We would like to make it clear to the Philippines that it should refrain from playing with fire on the Taiwan question,” said Mao. “We suggest President Marcos read more to develop a proper understanding of the ins and outs of the Taiwan question and come to a right conclusion.”China also summoned Philippine Ambassador to China Jaime Florcruz on Tuesday morning to “present a responsible response to China,” said Mao. The Philippine foreign ministry clarified in a statement on Tuesday that Marcos’ message was a reference to the large number of overseas Filipino workers (OFW) based in Taiwan and was the President’s “way of thanking [Taiwan] for hosting our OFWs and holding a successful democratic process.”“Nevertheless, the Philippines reaffirms its One China Policy,” the ministry said.

        "body_text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The director and producer of a banned Malaysian film that explores the afterlife were charged Wednesday with offending the religious feelings of others in a rare criminal prosecution of filmmakers, slammed by critics as an attack on freedom of expression.Mohamad Khairianwar Jailani, the director and co-scriptwriter of Mentega Terbang, and producer Tan Meng Kheng pleaded not guilty to having a “deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of others” through the independent, low-budget film. If found guilty, they could face up to a year in jail, a fine or both.Read More: Malaysia’s Defining Political Tension Takes the Concert StageDefense lawyer N. Surendran said the two believe the charge is “unreasonable and unconstitutional” because it violates their right to freedom of expression. “As far as we are concerned, these are groundless charges and we will challenge those charges in court,” he said.The film, which debuted at a regional film festival in 2021, revolves around a young Muslim girl who explores other religions to figure out where her ailing mother would go when she dies. Scenes that angered Muslims included ones showing the girl desiring to eat pork, which is forbidden in Islam, and pretending to drink holy water, and her father supporting her wish to leave Islam. It also sparked death threats against Khairianwar.The film was briefly shown on a Hong Kong streaming platform last year before it was removed. The Home Ministry banned the film last September without giving any reason. The two filmmakers filed a suit challenging the government’s decision before they were charged.Race and religion are sensitive issues in Malaysia. Ethnic Malays account for two-thirds of the country’s 33 million people and must be Muslims, with apostasy considered a sin. There are large ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities that are Buddhist, Hindu and Christian.Critics say religious conservatism has been on the rise in Malaysia, after an influential Malay-Islam alliance won strong gains in the November 2022 general election.Read More: Voters in Malaysia Jaded by Corruption Charges Are Turning More Toward Identity PoliticsHuman Rights Watch accused Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s government of prosecuting the two filmmakers to win political support from Malays.“This sort of crude political pandering at the expense of human rights is precisely the sort of thing that Anwar accused previous governments of doing when he was in the opposition—but now he’s hypocritically changed his tune after assuming power, and using the same censorship and persecution,” said the group’s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson.“The government should reverse course, uphold human rights principles, immediately direct prosecutors to drop these ludicrous, rights abusing charges, and lift the ban on the film Mentega Terbang,” he said.The court on Wednesday also forbid the two filmmakers from making statements about the case throughout the trial and ordered them to report to police monthly.Khairianwar has said this is likely the first time a filmmaker has been criminally charged in the country.“I am disappointed if this is a way to silence storytellers and concerned that it would make many more storytellers stop telling their stories out of fear of prosecution,” Khairianwar told the online news portal Free Malaysia Today a day before he was charged.",

        "title_text": "Qatar and France Broker Deal to Send Medicine to Hostages in Gaza as War Rages On",
        "body_text": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip — A shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas was en route to Gaza on Wednesday after France and Qatar mediated the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November.The medicines arrived in Egypt and were on the way to the border. A senior Hamas official said that for every box provided for the hostages, 1,000 boxes would be sent in for Palestinians. The deal also includes the delivery of humanitarian aid to residents of the besieged coastal enclave.The agreement came more than 100 days into a conflict that shows no sign of ending and which has sparked tensions across the Middle East, with a dizzying array of strikes and counterstrikes in recent days from northern Iraq to the Red Sea and from southern Lebanon to Pakistan.Palestinian militants are still putting up resistance across Gaza in the face of one of the deadliest military campaigns in recent history. Some 85% of the narrow coastal territory's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, and the United Nations says a quarter of the population is starving.Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas' military and governing abilities to ensure the group can never repeat an attack like the one on Oct. 7 that triggered the war. Militants burst through Israel's border defenses and stormed through several communities that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing around 250.Israel also has promised to return more than 100 hostages still held inside Gaza after Hamas in late November released most of the women and children held captive in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. Israel says only military pressure will bring about the release of more captives, who are at increased risk of being killed in Israeli strikes or during rescue operations as the fighting grinds on.Hamas has said it will not release any more hostages until there is a permanent cease-fire, something Israel and the United States, its top ally, have ruled out.In the past few days, a U.S.-led coalition has carried out strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen; Iran has struck what it described as an Israeli spy headquarters in northern Iraq and anti-Iran militants in Pakistan and Syria; and Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah have escalated the intensity of their fighting across the border.Iran's militant allies across the region say they are striking U.S. and Israeli targets to pressure the two countries to halt the Gaza offensive. Iran itself has encouraged the attacks while avoiding direct involvement, but appeared to be flexing its muscles with the strikes in Syria and Pakistan.The Houthis have vowed to continue attacking international shipping in the Red Sea in what they say is a blockade of Israel, with repercussions for global trade.Each party appears to be seeking some form of deterrence against its adversaries. But the longer the war in Gaza lasts, the more likely it is that one of them goes a step too far, potentially triggering another war.The biggest risk is along the Israel-Lebanon border, where Israel has vowed to halt Hezbollah attacks so that tens of thousands of Israelis can return to their homes in communities evacuated in October. Hezbollah hopes to take the pressure off Gaza by tying down Israeli troops in the north.Tensions are also soaring in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces have conducted near-daily arrest raids that often trigger shootouts with Palestinian militants.Israel said Wednesday that an airstrike in the urban Balata refugee camp in the northern West Bank killed five people. They included a senior militant who was involved in recent attacks on Israelis, the army alleged. Over 350 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7.Israel said at the start of the year that it had largely dismantled Hamas in northern Gaza and would scale back operations there, focusing on dense urban areas in the center and south of the territory. Additional Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza on Monday, but there has been little apparent letup in strikes, with scores of Palestinians killed every day.Gaza’s Health Ministry says 24,285 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children. Over 60,000 people have been wounded, and less than half of Gaza’s hospitals are even partially functioning.Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense residential areas. Israel says its forces have killed roughly 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 190 of its own soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive.Militants are still fighting in all parts of the territory, and Israel appears no closer to freeing the remaining hostages. The deaths of two more hostages were confirmed Tuesday after Hamas said they were killed in Israeli airstrikes.France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months' worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages as well as other medicine and vitamins. Several older men are among the remaining hostages held in Gaza.Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, said in a post on X that the International Committee of the Red Cross will deliver all the medicines, including the ones destined for the hostages, to hospitals serving all parts of Gaza.An Egyptian official confirmed the shipment had arrived at the el-Arish airport and said the Egyptian Red Crescent rescue service was transporting it to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. The official was not authorized to brief media and so spoke on condition of anonymity.Senior U.N. officials have warned that Gaza faces widespread famine and disease if more aid is not allowed in.Israel completely sealed off Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and only relented under U.S. pressure. It says there are now no limits on the entry of humanitarian aid and that U.N. agencies could reduce the delays by providing more workers and trucks.But U.N. officials say aid delivery is hobbled by the opening of too few border crossings, a slow vetting process, and continuing fighting throughout the territory — all of which is largely under Israel’s control.",

        "body_text": "LONDON — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces a test of his authority and his nerve on Wednesday as he tries to subdue a Conservative Party rebellion and win parliamentary approval for his stalled plan to send some asylum-seekers on a one-way trip to Rwanda.Lawmakers are due to vote on a bill that aims to overcome a U.K. Supreme Court block on the Rwanda plan, a day after some 60 members of Sunak’s governing Conservatives rebelled in an effort to make the legislation tougher. The dissent cost Sunak two party deputy chairmen, who quit in order to vote against the government on the amendments. A junior ministerial aide also resigned.A similar rebellion on Wednesday would doom the Safety of Rwanda Bill, and potentially Sunak’s 15-month-old government.Sunak has made the controversial — and expensive — immigration policy central to his attempt to win an election this year. To do that he needs to unite the Conservatives, who trail far behind the Labour opposition in opinion polls. But the liberal and law-and-order wings of the Conservatives — always uneasy allies — are at loggerheads over the Rwanda plan.Moderates worry the policy is too extreme, concerns underscored when the United Nations’ refugee agency said this week the Rwanda plan “is not compatible with international refugee law.”However, many on the party’s powerful right wing think the bill doesn't go far enough in deterring migration to the U.K. Hard-liners’ attempts to toughen the bill by closing down avenues of appeal for asylum-seekers failed Tuesday, and some of the Conservative rebels say they will oppose the legislation as a whole if it is not strengthened. If about 30 Tory lawmakers oppose the bill, it could be enough, along with opposition votes, to kill the legislation.But many Conservative lawmakers may hesitate to take the nuclear option of killing Sunak’s signature policy, a move that could trigger panicky moves to replace him or even spark a snap election. The government has to call a national election by the end of the year.Sunak insists the bill goes as far as the government can because Rwanda will pull out of its agreement to rehouse asylum-seekers if the U.K. breaks international law.Illegal Immigration Minister Michael Tomlinson said there was only an “inch of difference” between the government and its Conservative critics, and “actually we all want the same thing.”He said he was confident the bill “is going to get through tonight.”The Rwanda policy is key to Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” bringing unauthorized migrants to the U.K. across the English Channel from France. More than 29,000 people made the perilous journey in 2023, down from 42,000 the year before. Five people died during the weekend while trying to launch a boat from northern France in the dark and winter cold.London and Kigali made a deal almost two years ago under which migrants who reach Britain across the Channel would be sent to Rwanda, where they would stay permanently. Britain has paid Rwanda at least 240 million pounds ($305 million) under the agreement, but no one has yet been sent to the East African country.The plan has been criticized as inhumane and unworkable by human rights groups and challenged in British courts. In November the U.K. Supreme Court ruled the policy is illegal because Rwanda isn’t a safe country for refugees.In response to the court ruling, Britain and Rwanda signed a treaty pledging to strengthen protections for migrants. Sunak’s government argues that the treaty allows it to pass a law declaring Rwanda a safe destination.If approved by Parliament, the law would allow the government to “disapply” sections of U.K. human rights law when it comes to Rwanda-related asylum claims and make it harder to challenge the deportations in court.If the bill is passed by the House of Commons on Wednesday, it will go to the House of Lords, Parliament’s upper chamber, where it faces more opposition.",

        "body_text": "ABUJA, Nigeria — Three people died and 77 others were injured overnight when an explosives rocked more than 20 buildings in one of Nigeria’s largest cities, authorities said Wednesday, as rescue workers dug through the rubble in search of those feared trapped.Residents in the southwestern state of Oyo’s densely populated Ibadan city heard a loud blast at about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, causing panic as many fled their homes. By Wednesday morning, security forces cordoned off the area while medical personnel and ambulances were on standby as rescue efforts intensified.Preliminary investigations showed the blast was caused by explosives stored for use in illegal mining operations, Oyo Gov. Seyi Makinde told reporters after visiting the site in the Bodija area of Ibadan.“We have already deployed first responders and all relevant agencies within Oyo state to carry out comprehensive search and rescue operations,” Makinde said, describing the damage as “devastating.”Rescue workers combing through the collapsed structures recovered an additional body on Wednesday morning, increasing the death toll to three, Saheed Akiode, coordinator of Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency in the region, told The Associated Press.It was not immediately clear who stored the explosives, and no arrest has been announced. “The investigations are ongoing (and) all those found culpable for this will be brought to book,” Gov. Makinde said.Most of the 77 injured had already been discharged, the governor said, promising to cover the medical bills of others still being admitted and to provide temporary accommodation for those whose houses were affected.Dozens of residents trooped to the vicinity where some of the injured were being treated in ambulances. Surrounding the area are buildings covered in dust and either destroyed in whole or in part as a result of the blast, which left a massive crater.Illegal mining in mineral-rich Nigeria is common and has been a major concern for authorities. However, it is mostly done in remote areas where arrests are difficult and where safety procedures are rarely followed.The use of explosives such as dynamite by miners close to residential areas is also common and poses health hazards to residents, according to Anthony Adejuwon, who leads the Urban Alert group that advocates for accountability in the mining industry.Adejuwon said explosive materials should be kept far away from where people live, but that “the use of these explosives is not controlled and because they are not controlled, anybody that has easy access can keep it anywhere.”",

        "title_text": "U.K. Inflation Unexpectedly Rises After Cost of Tobacco Increases. What to Know",
        "body_text": "Inflation in the U.K. rose in December, contradicting earlier predictions and spelling trouble for politicians in power who had hailed a previous drop in prices. The country is still recovering from the crippling cost of living crisis last year. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who’s suffered from low favorability ratings as his Conservative party flounders in the polls, hailed that his government halved inflation—as promised— last year, although economic experts questioned whether he could take credit for that drop. Despite that downward trend, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 4% in the 12 months before December 2023, up from 3.9% in November, according to an Office of National Statistics (ONS) press release on Wednesday. It was the first time the rate increased since February 2023.Labour Member of Parliament Peter Dowd asked Sunak during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday if he would now take credit for the rise. Sunak responded that inflation in other countries, including the U.S., also saw a “mild uptick” in December. “The crucial thing is that inflation has been more than halved, delivered ahead of schedule, and that is having an enormous benefit to families up and down the country,” Sunak pushed back, claiming that progress would be reversed by Labour’s £28 billion ($35 billion) spending plan for green jobs that his party argues could raise taxes.  ONS tells TIME in an email that the December data doesn’t reflect expected price increases due to disruptions with Red Sea shipping amid relentless attacks from Yemen’s Houthi rebels in reported solidarity with Gaza after Hamas started a war with Israel. Here’s what you need to know about the U.K. inflation rate and what’s to come. The CPI tracks the prices of around 700 goods, including food, household bills and transport, the Bank of England explains. The CPI rose by 0.4% in December 2023, which was the same rate in December 2022, the government said. Inflation including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) rose by 4.2% in the 12 months leading up to December. The spike is largely reflected in alcohol and tobacco, while food and non-alcoholic beverages costs dropped over the past year, the government said.  Tobacco costs rose annually by 16%, and went up 4% between November and December, after the government announced higher taxes on the product in late November in its Autumn Statement. The government said on its website that it’s “committed to maintaining high tobacco duty rates” as a policy choice. “This is an established tool to reduce smoking prevalence and ensure that tobacco duties continue to contribute to government revenues,” the statement said. Alcohol prices also rose overall annually by 9.6%, although they fell by 1.6% between November and December. ONS tells TIME “there wasn’t any particular reason” alcohol became more expensive over the year. Overall inflation has dropped since last year, when CPI peaked at 11% in the 12 months before October 2022 amid economic policy whiplash under short-lived Prime Minister Liz Truss. The government said data suggests that month was the highest rate in more than 40 years.  The Bank of England said in December it expects inflation to slow and aims to reach the government’s target of 2% by the end of 2025. The government’s inflation calculator estimates that the average U.K. renter’s household monthly spending rose by £81 ($102) from December 2022 to 2023. The biggest rise was in tobacco, with average expenses jumping £11 ($14)––from £78 ($98) to £89 ($112) a month. Average monthly alcohol costs rose £7 ($9), from £80 ($101) to £87 ($110). The good news is that food dropped in price. For example, government price quotes show that an average two liters (half gallon) of milk cost around £1.45 ($1.84) in December 2023 compared to £1.65 ($2.09) in December 2022. The U.K. government will put out its next inflation report on Feb. 14, and tells TIME it is monitoring expected inflation impacts from Red Sea shipping disruptions. The attacks to cargo ships on the Red Sea have led to major shipping companies avoiding the route because it’s considered too dangerous, instead opting to take longer journeys. The actions of the Houthi rebels  prompted retaliatory air strikes by the U.S. and U.K. on militia targets in Yemen. The turmoil is expected to soon make goods such as coffee more expensive globally. Last week, experts told TIME that they expected to see shortages, shrinkflation or price rises as a result of the upsets within the next couple weeks.",

        "title_text": "Water Is the New Oil in the Gulf",
        "body_text": "In the arid desert landscapes of the Gulf, where oil has long been the region’s economic bedrock, a new narrative is unfolding—one where water’s increasing recognition as a critical and finite resource demands a reckoning. Under the most extreme climate scenario, temperatures in the region, already among the highest in the world and warming faster than elsewhere, could rise by nearly 6°C by the end of the century. Four of the six most water scarce countries in the world are in the Gulf—a phenomenon that is reshaping nearly every sector, from agriculture to energy—pushing leaders to tackle the issue in the face of climate change.Water stress in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE—is mostly driven by low supply. But it has been exacerbated by rapid population growth, which has nearly doubled in 20 years, alongside decades of skyrocketing incomes. Saudi Arabia, for example, which accounts for over 60% of the GCC population, is now the third highest per capita water consumer in the world, behind only the U.S. and Canada. Water scarcity has led the GCC to heavily rely on food imports from countries that are facing their own water and climate uncertainties. An estimated 60% of the world’s irrigated agriculture faces extremely high-water stress, adding another layer of vulnerability. This has motivated many GCC countries to increase national agricultural production. Although arable land in GCC countries is less than 5%, average agricultural water use accounts for 70-80% of the region’s renewable water resources. Agricultural water demand is primarily met through the massive exploitation of groundwater, causing a significant lowering of groundwater levels. (A 2019 study using NASA satellite data revealed the Arabian Peninsula as the most stressed of the world’s 37 largest aquifers.)In response to these realities, the Gulf is increasingly relying on seawater desalination. The GCC countries now generate about 40% of the world’s desalinated water from over 400 plants. Desalinated water provides some 42% of drinking water in the UAE, 70% in Saudi Arabia, 86% in Oman, and 90% in Kuwait. By 2025, Saudi Arabia aims to achieve a desalination capacity of 8.5 million cubic meters per day, equivalent to meeting the daily water needs of around 34 million households (four times the current number of households in Saudi Arabia). Desalination capacity of this volume requires multi-billion-dollar investments over many years.But doubling down on desalination is a blessing and a curse. While desalination provides a crucial freshwater supply, the emissions and ecological costs cannot be ignored. By 2050, the worldwide emissions from desalination is expected to reach 0.4 billion tons of CO2 equivalents per year—equal to the carbon footprint of producing over 8 billion barrels of oil. The energy-intensive nature of desalination poses challenges as Gulf nations aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and transition to sustainable energy sources.Use of the more energy efficient reverse osmosis membrane-based desalination technologies, rather than the thermal variety using energy from plants, is growing but the region as a whole still relies on the more energy-intensive method. There are some bright spots; membrane desalination accounts for 50% and 60% of capacity in Saudi Arabia and Oman, respectively, and it continues to grow by the day. Saudi Arabia’s planned smart city initiative, NEOM, will rely on water from a reverse osmosis desalination facility entirely powered by renewable energy.There is also the matter of brine, which is a byproduct of desalination. Every 1 liter (0.26 gallons) of desalinated water requires 1.5 to 2 liters (0.4 to 0.53 gallons) of seawater intake—1 liter will be potable water and the rest will be brine. The brine is then typically dumped back into the sea. It is estimated that around 55% of the world’s brine is produced by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar. As a result, the waters of the Gulf are now believed to be 25% saltier than seawater elsewhere. The excess salt decreases oxygen levels in the water, suffocating marine life on the seafloor. More research is needed to better understand the ecological impact of brine.Desalination also carries geopolitical threats. Changing policies related to energy distribution or fluctuations in the global oil market could impact the operation and management of desalination plants. They are also vulnerable to physical and cyber threats, and if they were to cease running, most GCC countries only have a few days of water reserves. The likelihood of a successful attack is low but the consequences nevertheless catastrophic. For these reasons, there is an increasing recognition of the need for holistic and sustainable water management strategies. The best course of action would focus on four key areas to reduce water security threats. Firstly, that means reducing water demand through smart policies and conservation awareness campaigns. Recalibrating agricultural practices, promoting efficient irrigation methods, fixing excessive leakage in distribution networks, and considering imports for water-intensive crops are essential steps. That also means scrapping water subsidies and even enacting reasonable tariffs. Complementary regulatory measures, such as instituting green building specifications and establishing standards for water-efficient utilities, are also avenues to mitigate demand pressures.Secondly, increasing and diversifying the water supply. Treated effluent reuse for non-drinking water and groundwater replenishment are significant and untapped opportunities for the region. Currently about 40% of wastewater is being reused in the Gulf; the World Bank estimates that GCC countries could treat and reuse up to 90% of this effluent for agricultural, industrial, and domestic use. Although scarcer and variable, rainwater capture can also effectively replenish groundwater in some GCC countries.Thirdly, investing in research and development to decarbonize desalination and reduce the environmental costs of brine. Accelerating the commercialization of less energy-intensive desalination facilities powered by renewable energy, increasing the overall efficiency of desalination technologies, and exploring ways to reduce and reuse brine effluent are key parts of that. Research into the social, cultural, religious, and political dimensions of these emerging water resources is also important to promoting their acceptance and adoption. Attitudes toward the reuse of wastewater are especially terse due to religious and cultural norms. Fourthly, greater collaboration among GCC countries is essential. Collaborative efforts will allow these nations to pool their experiences, best practices, and innovative solutions to address common issues more effectively. Importantly, this would also enable the region to develop solutions that are culturally appropriate and uniquely suited to the Gulf, while also using science and technology as a diplomatic tool.With a projected 30% population increase in the next decade, the Gulf must take significant steps to secure its water future. The water crisis has the potential to reshape regional priorities, affecting economic stability, political alliances, and social dynamics. But they also present an opportunity for innovation and adaptation. Leadership by GCC countries to decarbonize, diversify, and reduce the demand on their water resources will not only help the region adapt to increasing water security risks, but also provide tools for other arid countries dealing with similar challenges.",

        "title_text": "U.S. Puts Houthis Rebels Back on List of Global Terrorists",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON  — The United States on Wednesday put Yemen's Houthis rebels back on its list of specially designated global terrorists, piling financial sanctions on top of American military strikes in the Biden administration's latest attempt to stop the militants' attacks on global shipping.Officials said they would design the financial penalties to minimize harm to Yemen's 32 million people, who are among the world's poorest and hungriest after years of war between the Iran-backed Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition.But aid officials expressed concern. The decision would only add \"another level of uncertainty and threat for Yemenis still caught in one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises,” Oxfam America associate director Scott Paul said.The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing.President Donald Trump's administration designated the Houthis as global terrorists and a foreign terrorist organization in one of his last acts in office. President Joe Biden reversed course early on, at the time citing the humanitarian threat that the sanctions posed to ordinary Yemenis.Military strikes by the U.S. and Britain against Houthi targets in Yemen have failed to stop weeks of drone, rocket and missile strikes by Houthi forces on commercial shipping transiting the Red Sea route, which borders Yemen.The Houthis are one in a network of Iran- and Hamas-allied militant groups around the Middle East that have escalated attacks on Israel, the U.S. and others since Israel's military offensive in Gaza, in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.The Houthis were originally a clan-based rebel movement. They seized Yemen's capital in 2014 and withstood a subsequent yearslong invasion led by Saudi Arabia aimed at driving the Houthis from power. Two-thirds of Yemen's people live in territory now controlled by the Houthis.Critics say the additional broad U.S. sanctions may have little effect on the Houthis, a defiant and relatively isolated group with few known assets in the U.S. to be threatened. There is also concern that designating the Houthis as terrorists may complicate international attempts to broker a peace deal in the now-subsided war with Saudi Arabia.War and chronic misgovernment have left 24 million Yemenis at risk of hunger and disease, and roughly 14 million are in acute need of humanitarian assistance, the United Nations says. Aid groups during the height of Yemen's war issued repeated warnings that millions of Yemenis were on the brink of famine.Aid organizations worry that just the fear of running afoul of U.S. regulations could be enough to scare away shippers, banks and others in the commercial supply chain that Yemenis depend upon for survival. Yemen imports 90% of its food.U.S. officials said the sanctions would exempt commercial shipments of food, medicine and fuel, and humanitarian assistance into Yemeni ports. The U.S. will wait 30 days to put the sanctions into effect, officials said, giving shipping companies, banks, insurers and others time to prepare.Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement that the U.S. would roll out “unprecedented\" exemptions in the sanctions for staples including food to “help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni people,” adding that they “should not pay the price for the actions of the Houthis.”The administration, for now, is not reimposing the more severe designation of foreign terrorist organization on the Houthis. That would have barred Americans, along with people and organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, from providing “material support” to the Houthis. Aid groups said that step could have the effect of criminalizing ordinary trade and assistance to Yemenis.The U.S will reevaluate the designation if the Houthis comply, Sullivan said.Jared Rowell, the Yemen country director for the International Rescue Committee, said last week that the attacks and counterattacks already were interrupting the delivery of goods and aid into Yemen, delaying shipments of vital commodities and raising prices for food and fuel.Conservatives have pressed for the foreign terrorist designation to be reimposed ever since the Biden administration lifted it. Calls for tougher action against the Houthis and and their Iranian backers have grown louder since the Israel-Hamas war.When Biden was asked last week whether the Houthis were a terrorist group, he replied, “I think they are.”Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdul-Salam said the U.S. terrorist label would not deter the group. “Instead, we consider it a badge of honor for Yemen for its support of Palestinian resistance in Gaza,” Abdul-Salam said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.Hisham Al-Omeisy, a Yemeni analyst living in the Washington, area, said the U.S. designation plays into the Houthis’ narrative to the world that they are standing up to a superpower to champion Muslims everywhere.At home, the designation helps the Houthis' message to Yemenis that the U.S. is the cause of their suffering, Al-Omeisy said.In the past, he said, the Houthis were angered that “the U.S. was basically treating them as a bug on the windshield.”Now, \"they’re like, ‘You know what, they respect us,’” he said of the Houthis' attitude. “‘Yeah, we can go toe to toe with the Americans, right?’”It's not clear if any U.S. partners are working on similar sanctions.European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said the EU “is working intensively with partners and coordinating in the international efforts to stop these unacceptable violations of international law, which bring dangers to freedom and safety of navigation in the Red Sea.”He told reporters Wednesday that the 27 member countries are discussing the possibility of setting up a naval mission to help “restore the stability and safety of naval traffic in the Red Sea.” He declined to comment on whether sanctions are being discussed.",

        "body_text": "Singapore’s Transport Minister S. Iswaran resigned after being charged with corruption in the biggest political scandal in almost four decades, which has cast a pall on the city-state known for clean governance.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong accepted Iswaran’s resignation as a cabinet minister and lawmaker, according to a statement from Lee’s office. Iswaran, who’s out on bail, rejected the 27 charges against him, including allegedly obtaining tickets to musicals and soccer matches in the U.K. “I am determined to uphold the integrity of the party and the government, and our reputation for honesty and incorruptibility,” Lee said in the statement, referring to the ruling People’s Action Party. “Singaporeans expect no less.”Read More: A Wave of Scandals Is Testing the Singaporean Government’s Ability to Take CriticismIswaran, 61, is the first key minister to get embroiled in a graft probe since 1986 when then-Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan was investigated for accepting bribes. Teh denied receiving the money and died before he could be formally charged.Iswaran, 61, is the first key minister to get embroiled in a graft probe since 1986. He and property tycoon Ong Beng Seng were arrested in July in a case that’s challenged Singapore’s reputation for clean governance at a time when Lee is seeking to step aside after almost two decades of leading the country. “I reject the allegations in the charges and will now focus on clearing my name,” Iswaran wrote in his resignation letter to Lee that was made public after the charges were announced. The former politician was slapped with an array of charges that spanned from 2015 to May 2023. They included two counts of corruption, 24 counts of obtaining “valuable things” from someone he had business dealings with as a public servant, and one for obstructing justice. If convicted, he faces fines and a possible jail term.  “This is not just a legal battle for Iswaran and the public prosecutor,” said Eugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University. “There is now a political battle for the government to renew trust and confidence to the voters that they have an upright system.” Lee, 71, is expected to hand over the reins to his deputy Lawrence Wong by November in a long-telegraphed succession. Wong said Thursday those plans remain on track. “As far as the impact on succession is concerned, there will be no impact,” Wong told reporters. “Will this incident have an impact on the party and party morale? I have no doubt that it will, but we cannot allow this political hit to compromise our zero-tolerance stance against corruption.”The corruption scandal is one in a series of controversies that had sent shockwaves through the PAP, which had two lawmakers unexpectedly resigning over an affair. In September, the son of former premier Goh Chok Tong was among four people charged for false trading offenses.Iswaran and Ong would have interacted over the years, with the minister’s roles in trade and transport intersecting with the property tycoon known for helping bring the Formula One Grand Prix to Singapore. Iswaran has long championed the Singapore F1 night race in his various capacities.The charges include favors the former minister allegedly obtained from Ong such as tickets to musicals on the West End from Kinky Boots and Book of Mormon to Waitress. He also allegedly obtained tickets to U.K. soccer matches, a flight on Ong’s private jet, a S$4,738 ($3,527) stay for one night at the Four Seasons Doha and tickets to the F1 in Singapore.For the moment, there is nothing to suggest that the F1 contracts were structured to the disadvantage of the government, and all preparations for the F1 Singapore Grand Prix this year remain on track, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a response to media queries. The Attorney-General’s Chambers said it will decide on Ong and others after the case against Iswaran has been completed. Ong’s spokesperson declined to comment. Iswaran said he will return his salary and allowances since July. His pay was slashed to S$8,500 a month, marking an 82% cut from a starting salary of S$46,750 in Singapore, where government leaders are among the best paid in the world to avoid corruption.",

        "body_text": "QUITO, Ecuador — A prosecutor investigating a dramatic attack on the set of a public television channel last week was shot to death Wednesday in Guayaquil, the most dangerous city in Ecuador.Prosecutor César Suárez, who had carried out other high-profile investigations in the past, was shot while driving a vehicle, Attorney General Diana Salazar said.“Organized crime groups, criminals, terrorists will not stop our commitment to society,” she said in a video broadcast on X, formerly Twitter.Thirteen alleged perpetrators have been arrested in the assault at TC Television, which was broadcast live and led President Daniel Noboa to declare that Ecuador is in an “internal armed conflict\" amid a surge of killings and other crimes tied to drug trafficking.Read More: Ecuador in Turmoil After ‘Most Wanted’ Criminal Escapes PrisonSuárez was also in charge of the Metastasis case involving an Ecuadorian drug lord who allegedly received favorable treatment from judges, prosecutors, police officers and high officials.Ecuadorian police said they were working to find those responsible for the murder of Suárez.Ecuador has been rocked by a series of attacks, including the abductions of several police officers, in the wake of a notorious gang leader’s apparent weekend escape from prison.José Adolfo Macías Villamar, leader of Los Choneros, one of the Ecuadorian gangs considered responsible for a spike in car bombings, kidnappings and slayings, was discovered missing from his prison cell where he was serving a sentence for drug trafficking.His disappearance earlier this month led the government to declare a state of emergency that involved sending the military into prisons, which sparked a wave of at least 30 attacks around the South American country, including the assault at the television station in Guayaquil.",

        "title_text": "U.S. Launches More Strikes on Yemen’s Houthis as Rebel Group’s Red Sea Attacks Continue",
        "body_text": "The U.S. launched more strikes on Yemen’s Houthis overnight as the Iran-backed militant group continues to roil global shipping markets with attacks around the Red Sea.The American military targeted 14 Houthi missiles just before midnight Yemeni time. They were ready to be launched and presented “an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region,” Central Command said.Yemeni media reported blasts in areas including the port city of Hodeida and the province of Saada near the border with Saudi Arabia. It was at least the fourth round of U.S.-led strikes on Yemen since the first on Jan. 12.Hours later, Pakistan launched missiles against militants in Iran, in the latest incident roiling the wider Middle East. Since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted in October, the Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea, U.S. bases have come under fire from Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria, and Tehran has struck targets in neighboring countries.Read More: Iran Fires Missiles at Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan, Killing at Least 6 Civilians: What to KnowIt wasn’t immediately clear how extensive the damage was or whether there were casualties in the latest American response to the Houthis. The group’s missile and drone strikes since mid-November have disrupted global trade, forcing most vessels to avoid the Red Sea and sail a much longer route to or from Europe around southern Africa.The cost of sending containers between Europe and Asia has soared in recent weeks. The reaction in energy markets has been more muted, with production in oil-rich Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran itself unaffected.Crude prices rose on Thursday following the US strikes, though only slightly and Brent remains below $80 a barrel.Shortly before the U.S. launched more missiles on Yemen, the American-owned Genco Picardy was attacked by a drone in the Gulf of Aden, near the southern end of the Red Sea. Centcom, responsible for the U.S. military in the Middle East and parts of Asia, described the vessel as a bulk-goods carrier registered in the Marshall Islands. The ship sustained some damage, but no injuries were reported and it remained seaworthy. It was the third ship targeted by the militants since the U.S.-led strikes on Yemen began last week. The initial barrage included around 150 launches from surface ships, submarines and British fighter jets. The two countries hit military airports, radar installations and storage and launch sites for drones and missiles.Read More: How Congress Reacted to Biden’s Military Attack on the Houthis in YemenA small number of Houthi fighters have died in the attacks, but there haven’t been reports of civilian deaths.The U.S. strikes followed repeated warnings to the Houthis, some of them via Iran, to stop their attacks. The group says it won’t back down until Israel pulls out of Gaza.The U.S. is trying weaken the Houthis’ ability to disrupt commercial shipping. But Wednesday’s attack on the Genco Picardy indicates they still have weaponry at their disposal and the means to fire missiles, something that may force President Joe Biden to continue striking Yemen.“The actions by the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt the commercial shipping lanes,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, Centcom’s commander. “We will continue to take actions to protect the lives of innocent mariners and we will always protect our people.”For Washington and its allies, the concern is that a deeper campaign in Yemen could exacerbate the various but inter-linked conflicts in the Middle East, which began when Hamas sent militants into Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people.Read More: History Suggests U.S. Airstrikes Against the Houthis Will BackfireIsrael’s retaliatory attack on Gaza has killed more than 24,000 people and created a humanitarian disaster, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave, infuriating governments in the Arab and Muslim worlds.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war won’t stop until Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the US and others, is destroyed. The government and its generals have said fighting in Gaza will last many more months, if not longer.Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal Bin Farhan, said this week he’s “incredibly concerned for regional security” and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.“Continuing as we are now — continuing to see the suffering that’s happening in Gaza — is likely to lead to continuing cycles of escalation” in the Middle East, he said.Read More: For Antony Blinken, the War in Gaza Is a Test of U.S. PowerEarlier on Wednesday, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron met this Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Cameron said the Houthi attacks in international waters were “illegal and unacceptable, and that Iran must use its influence” to stop them.Iran has said that while it supports the Houthis’ cause, they attack independently and don’t take instructions from Tehran.The Houthis initially said they were only going after Israel-linked vessels, though they targeted those with no obvious connection to the Jewish state. Since the U.S. and U.K. strikes, the Houthis have said all American and British assets are legitimate targets.Read More: How—and Why—Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Are Poised to Seriously Disrupt the Global EconomyLate last month, the U.S. and some of its allies created a maritime task force — dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian — to protect ships transiting the Red Sea. It’s largely restricted itself to defending vessels under attack and the U.S. has said its strikes on Yemen are seperate to the task force.A growing number of ships are taking the unusual step of flagging on websites and elsewhere that they have no link to Israel, in a bid to gain safe passage through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.On Wednesday, the U.S. said it will put the Houthis back on a global terrorism list. Biden revoked that designation early in his presidency as part of a plan to ease a humanitarian crisis in Yemen after years of civil war.The Houthis, who took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014 at the start of Yemen’s war, hold much of the north-west of the country. They withstood a massive bombing campaign from a Saudi-led coalition that began a year later and remain firmly entrenched.",

        "body_text": "Former Calif. Governor and Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger was temporarily held by customs officials at Munich Airport Wednesday after failing to declare a luxury watch in his luggage while on his way to Austria, according to German media. German tabloid Bild, which first reported on Schwarzenegger’s detention, said the 76-year-old actor stayed with German authorities for around three hours after they found a custom-made Audemars Piguet wristwatch—worth nearly $30,000—in his luggage.Criminal tax proceedings were initiated against Schwarzenegger, according to the tabloid, with a customs spokesperson saying the watch “should have been registered because it is an import.”Schwarzenegger reportedly told customs officials that he was planning to auction the watch for a good cause—his non-profit Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative has a fundraising event scheduled in the town of Kitzbühel near Austria’s Kaiser Mountains on Thursday. Still, the German officials reportedly charged Schwarzenegger some $38,000, including more than $4,000 in tax value and a more than $5,000 penalty, according to Bild. An unidentified source told CBS that the actor had not been asked to fill out a declaration form and tried to pay the dues at the airport with a credit card—but the machine was not working. Bild reported that customs officials ended up accompanying Schwarzenegger to a bank terminal to withdraw the money.The actor was expected to continue on his journey but a customs spokesperson told Agence-France Presse that “the watch will probably have to stay.”“This is the problem that Germany is suffering from. You can no longer see the forest for the trees,” Schwarzenegger told Bild.A spokesperson for Munich main customs told German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung: “If the goods remain in the EU, you have to declare them through customs. This applies to everyone, whether their name is Schwarzenegger or Müller, Meier, Huber.”Other items up for bidding at the fundraiser Schwarzenegger was slated to attend include a “training session” with the former bodybuilding champion himself, as well as “artworks, signed exhibits, and experiences from the worlds of sports and film.”",

        "body_text": "Pakistan’s military carried out targeted strikes against militant hideouts in Iran on Thursday, responding to an attack by Tehran a day earlier in a rare escalation of tensions that both sides signaled they don’t want to see get worse. Read More: Iran Fires Missiles at Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan, Killing at Least 6 Civilians: What to KnowPakistan carried out morning strikes against “terrorist hideouts” in Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The move followed Iran’s strikes against Jaish al-Adl, a separatist group based in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.“This action is a manifestation of Pakistan’s unflinching resolve to protect and defend its national security against all threats,” the foreign ministry said in a statement explaining its retaliatory actions. As many as nine foreigners were killed in the strike, including four children, were killed, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency.The tit-for-tat response is the most significant escalation between the two neighbors, both allies of China who have had strained relations in the past. While the strikes come at a time of rising turmoil in the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war, Pakistani and Iranian officials also moved to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian phoned his Pakistani counterpart on Wednesday in an apparent move to ease tensions, even as Islamabad insisted it had the right to respond to the “illegal act” by Tehran. “Both sides right now will try to de-escalate while saving face, and the Chinese must be getting involved because they have close ties with both sides,” Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute of the National University of Singapore. Pakistan’s interim Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq cut short a trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Thursday to help manage the crisis. That came after Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic ties by recalling its envoy to Tehran and asking the Iranian ambassador not to return to Islamabad. But there were words of caution as well. “Pakistan has also always emphasized dialogue and cooperation,” Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday. “We will continue to engage with our neighbor Iran to ensure that peace prevails and that the two countries make concerted and coordinated efforts to combat the threat of terrorism.”Baloch said Pakistan and Iran have “several channels of communication” to discuss the latest events.Even Pakistan’s army, which in a statement said it used “killer drones, rockets, loitering munitions and stand-off weapons” in its strikes, added that, “Going forward, dialogue and cooperation is deemed prudent in resolving bilateral issues between the two neighboring brotherly countries.”China also said it is tracking the developments. “We hope both parties can exercise restraint and calmness, and can avoid escalation,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, said Thursday. Oil gained as the latest incidents underlined the region’s tensions, which have already created headwinds for global shipping and carry the potential for interruptions to crude production. Brent crude rose above $78 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate topped $73.The developments come at a particularly sensitive time for Pakistan, which is scheduled to hold delayed national elections early next month. It also takes place with Iranian-backed proxies engaged in conflicts in Israel and the Red Sea, with much of the world fearing a broader regional conflagration. Iran also undertook limited strikes in Iraq this week, saying they targeted a “Israeli spy base.”Iran said its strikes in Pakistan were aimed at Jaish al-Adl, a separatist group based in a largely ungoverned area bordering Iran that Tehran says has been a source of instability. Pakistan said that attack killed two children and injured three others.Jaish al-Adl is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and the Sunni militant group operates along predominantly Shiite Iran’s porous border with Pakistan. It’s launched multiple attacks on Iranian security forces, most recently a December assault on a police station that killed 11 people.As many as nine people were killed during Pakistan’s return attack, which hit in two locations around the border city of Saravan at around 4:30 a.m., AFP reported, citing Iranian media.",

        "body_text": "Fireworks are used across the world to mark joyous occasions—from New Year’s Day to Lunar New Year to Diwali to the Fourth of July—but behind the boisterous crackle and brilliant flashes meant to elicit gasps and cheers from festive crowds lie immense safety risks, not just to users and environments but especially to the people making them.In Thailand on Wednesday, an explosion at a fireworks factory in the country’s central region killed an estimated 20 workers, as the worksite was completely demolished, leaving behind no survivors and injuring many others in the surrounding area, local authorities said.The deadly disaster was just the latest among dozens that Thailand’s fireworks industry has seen over the last two decades. (Another explosion at the same factory in 2022 killed one person, while a similar blast in southern Thailand last year killed 12 people and left over 100 injured.)Such accidents aren’t limited to Thailand either: China and India, which have long served as the manufacturing hubs for the world’s fireworks, have experienced a number of headline-grabbing factory explosions over the years. Last October, 14 people died across two fireworks factory explosions in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. And earlier, in July, an explosion at an illegal fireworks factory in central China killed at least five people. Amid mounting concerns over the danger of the global fireworks industry, advocates have been calling for government officials and factory operators to adopt safety measures at production sites to mitigate the risks of injurious and fatal accidents. Here’s what to know:In buildings filled with combustible material, even small flames can be devastatingly destructive. In 2014, a massive blast ripped through a fireworks factory in southern China and killed 12 people. Someone who was sweeping highly combustible rice hulls—a crucial ingredient in fireworks—had generated enough friction to set off a fire, triggering a chain of explosions across the factory’s buildings, which were tightly packed with material and people.Terry Winkle, an American fireworks business owner who had visited the factory years earlier, described the facility in a 2016 investigative report by Slate and ChinaFile as “an accident waiting to happen.”“I thought, ‘If something happens, there’s a lot of people going down,’” he said.Researchers studying the dangers of fireworks production have also emphasized the importance of safety training among workers. A 2023 study of over 100 fireworks production accidents in China found that the biggest factors affecting the likelihood of such accidents include safety education and training, the physical and mental state of workers, and management of the workplace. However, amid loosely observed safety rules and the prevalence of illegally operating factories, such safety awareness is often lacking. In a 2014 survey of Indian fireworks factory workers in Tamil Nadu, 92% reported not receiving training for their tasks, and 97% said their managers did not give them safety tools or attires for work.Despite the industry’s obvious hazards, demand for fireworks products continues to soar—the global fireworks market, estimated to be worth $2.7 billion in 2022, is expected to reach $3.8 billion by 2031.That demand has made efforts to regulate or restrict the industry much harder. Even when governments have tried banning fireworks due to environmental and public health concerns, such measures often fall flat when faced with enthusiastic crowds. While India has annual bans on fireworks near Diwali amid air pollution, they are seldom enforced or observed; when Chinese cities recently banned fireworks ahead of Lunar New Year in February, public backlash quickly ensued.In an attempt to prevent further tragedies in fireworks factories, authorities have cracked down on operators with heavy penalties. After the 2014 accident in southern China that killed 12, the factory’s boss was sentenced to six years in prison for negligence and flouting safety regulations. (A similar accident in the country’s northeast that killed 38 people in 2003 saw the owner of an unlicensed fireworks factory sentenced to death.)Meanwhile, researchers have recommended using safer substitute materials to make fireworks, such as reducing the amount of aluminum in flash powders by adding boron, a chemical that has a higher ignition threshold.Others point to the importance of designing architecture that minimizes casualties in case of disaster. In the wake of Wednesday’s factory explosion in Thailand, a Thai environmental and health expert told the Bangkok Post that fireworks factories or warehouses should be fenced in a “bubble zone” with, depending on how many fireworks they contain, a buffer area of 100 to 500 meters (109 to 547 yards) that outsiders are banned from entering.",

        "title_text": "India Is Unveiling Its Controversial Temple of Ram. Here’s What to Know",
        "body_text": "A decades-long flashpoint in India’s sectarian politics is poised to reach a climax next week. The Ram Mandir, a Hindu temple, will be consecrated Jan 22. on a contested holy site once home to a mosque in India’s northern city of Ayodhya. The special ceremony for the temple, which is still in construction, has been a decades-long effort in the making.For Hindus, site marks the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the most revered deities in the Hindu faith. But the site is also revered by Muslims for having once housed the 16th century Babri Mosque, a monument of faith for Indian Muslims that stood on the site for centuries before it was razed by a Hindu nationalist mob in 1992. Sectarian riots ensued, killing thousands of people.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu-nationalist government has overseen a steady rise in violence against Muslims and other religious minorities, will play a key role in the ceremony—one observers say will mark the unofficial start of his campaign to win a third consecutive term when Indians go to the polls in the spring. It’s for this reason that leaders of the opposition Congress Party have opted to skip the ceremony, which they describe as nothing more than “a political project … obviously brought forward for electoral gain.”Read More: How India’s Hindu Nationalists Are Weaponizing History Against MuslimsWhile the Indian government, and indeed many Hindus, regard the Jan. 22 consecration as a celebratory occasion of immense national and religious importance, observers fear that the event could signify yet another nail in the coffin of India’s secular ethos. “The Ram Mandir revolves around some of the most divisive issues for religion and society in contemporary India,” Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, tells TIME in an email. “The temple consecration is papering over incredibly traumatic and heavily contested events in India’s history.” Here’s what to know about the event.What will the ceremony entail?Tens of thousands of devotees are expected to converge on the holy city of Ayodhya, which some Hindu nationalist leaders have taken to calling the “Hindu Vatican.” While construction of the Ram Mandir temple, which broke ground in 2020, isn’t due to be completed until December, next week’s ceremony will mark the official consecration of the site, involving several days of elaborate rituals.But the festivities won’t be confined to Ayodhya. Celebrations surrounding the consecration are due to take place nationwide, buttressed by wall-to-wall coverage in the run-up to the event. Saffron flags, a symbol of Hindu nationalism, have already become ubiquitous.In addition to Modi, who will play a key role as the official patron of the consecration, a number of other politicians, religious figures, movie stars, and celebrities are also expected to attend. What is the significance of the Ayodhya site for Modi?For Modi, the construction of the Ram Temple represents more than just the honoring of a decades-long Hindu nationalist pledge (rebuilding the temple, which was greenlit by India’s Supreme Court in 2019, has been a core project of Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party). It also cements his legacy as one of the country’s most consequential leaders—in particular, one who is helping to transform India from a secular democracy into an avowedly Hindu nation.The Ram Mandir movement has been a throughline of Modi’s career, says Rana Ayyub, one of India’s most famous journalists and a renowned thorn in the side of Modi’s BJP. In 1990, as a local BJP leader in his native Gujarat, Modi helped organize a religious rally that aimed to gin up support for the construction of a temple to Lord Ram on the site of the Babri Mosque. In January 1992, less than a year before the mosque was destroyed, Modi pledged not to return to Ayodhya until a temple dedicated to Lord Ram was completed. Nearly three decades later, Modi oversaw the groundbreaking of the temple, likening it to “the day India gained independence.”“His entire career has been based on Ayodhya because he realized early on that the only way to become a favorite of the masses is to endear them through the Ram Temple movement,” Ayyub says. “This is the ultimate movement of Modi as a Hindu nationalist leader, and this is the ultimate moment of creating the Indian Muslim as a second-class citizen.”The temple consecration follows a number of other major political moves implemented by Modi in his efforts to advance his government’s Hindu nationalist agenda.This includes the passage of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act in 2019 (a law extending Indian citizenship to religious minorities from neighboring countries that excludes Muslims, undermining India’s constitutionally mandated secularism) and the repeal of the special autonomous status of India-administered Kashmir, the country’s sole Muslim-majority state. “What unites these three things is that they work against Indian Muslims and Muslims more broadly,” says Kugelman, “and, by extension, strengthen the status and interests of Indian Hindus.”Read More: India’s Ayodhya Temple Is a Huge Monument to Hindu SupremacyHow are India’s Muslims reacting?For many Indian Muslims, who make up just 15% of the population, the destruction of the Babri Mosque remains an open wound, says Ayyub. “To be constantly reminded of the scar,” she says, “and now to be told that the entire nation is celebrating this temple being built on a mosque—it’s like rubbing salt into an already existing wound.”Beyond pain, however, Ayyub says many Indian Muslims also feel fear. For her part, she has instructed her family to be careful about how they react to WhatsApp messages within their housing society. “At this point in time, anything can be used as a grind against us,” she says. “This is like that moment that we all feared and it is at our doorstep right now, and we don’t know what to make of it.”While authorities are expected to be on high-alert on the day of the consecration, some observers fear that the moment could spark unrest. “The government will be prepared and will pull out all the stops to have as much security as possible,” says Kugelman. “But it will be a tense moment for many, and especially Indian Muslims, despite New Delhi’s projection of the event as an opportunity for the nation to come together to celebrate.”What impact is this expected to have on India’s the upcoming election?2024 stands to be a consequential election year for countries around the world, and India is no exception. Polls project that Modi, who remains widely popular, could win a third consecutive term. Experts such as Kugelman see the temple inauguration as a key element of his campaign. “The temple consecration is a powerful reflection of Modi’s campaign strategy,” he says, noting that Modi has linked the temple with a series of neighboring infrastructure and welfare projects. “In that sense, he’s combining Hindu nationalism with social welfare—his two signature themes not only in this election, but in his broader politics. It’s a combination that’s worked well for him.”",

        "title_text": "India’s Ayodhya Temple Is a Huge Monument to Hindu Supremacy",
        "body_text": "On Jan. 22, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate a three-story monument made of marble, sandstone, and teak that features 44 gates and 392 intricately-carved pillars. But the structure, built on a vast 70-acre plot, may be the least remarkable part of the new Ayodhya temple. Its controversial inauguration atop the ruins of a 16th-century mosque marks the culmination of a three-decade promise made by Modi, his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and other Hindu nationalist groups—and serves as the biggest political testament yet to Hindu supremacy over Indian Muslims. Ayodhya is a town in northern India that, for centuries, was home to the Babri Masjid. The mosque was built in 1527 by a general associated with the Mughal Emperor Babur and was a rare surviving example of the architecture of the early Mughal Empire, which ruled parts of India from the 16th to 19th centuries. Muslims, India’s largest religious minority, worshipped in the mosque for more than 300 years without issue.In the 1850s, when India was largely under British colonial rule, the first signs of trouble arose as the Babri Masjid emerged as a key site of Hindu nationalist attempts to rectify perceived historical wrongs by Muslims, an idea inherited from British colonialists. Hindus claimed that Lord Ram, a major god and mythological hero, had been born at the very spot on which the mosque stood. Competing claims of Ram’s birthplace were once attached to many sites in Ayodhya, but the Babri Masjid drew particular fervor because it was a mosque. Some imagined further historical wrongs associated with the Babri Masjid, including claiming that the mosque was built after Babur’s general destroyed a Hindu temple at that location. None of these claims stand up to historical scrutiny. But in the 1980s, Hindu nationalist groups began tapping into these claims to argue that the mosque needed to be destroyed to clear the way for a new Hindu temple, declaring Mandir wahi banayenge (“The temple will be built right there!”). After years of agitation, their efforts resulted in an explosion of Islamophobic violence on Dec. 6, 1992, when a Hindu mob numbering at least 75,000 descended on Ayodhya and dismantled the Babri Masjid, brick-by-brick. The mob’s anti-Muslim iconoclasm extended to people, and many Muslims in Ayodhya fled the city that day, fearing for their lives. In the days that followed, communal riots that rocked various Indian cities claimed about 2,000 lives, most of them Muslim. A subsequent report commissioned by the Indian government found dozens of people—many of whom are now BJP political leaders—responsible for orchestrating and encouraging the attacks.The BJP benefited from stirring up Hindu nationalism around the Babri Masjid, and in 2014 swept into power, displacing the more pluralistic Indian Congress Party. The BJP then began to remake democratic India into a Hindu supremacist state. Following a second BJP national victory in 2019, India’s Supreme Court—whose autonomy has been undercut by the Modi government—issued its final judgment that decided the fate of the Babri Masjid site. The court called the mosque’s destruction “an egregious violation of the rule of law,” but nonetheless ruled that a Hindu temple could be built on the mosque’s rubble. Modi laid the foundation stone at a groundbreaking ceremony in August 2020, and will finish what the BJP and other Hindu supremacists began more than 30 years ago by consecrating the Ayodhya temple surrounded by his Hindu nationalist peers.Still, the event will be marked by conspicuous absences. Leaders of the opposition Congress party will skip the festivities, in protest over what they rightly see as a consecration that is more a political ploy than a religious ceremony. Even some Hindu leaders agree, arguing that the Ayodhya temple cannot be consecrated since it remains incomplete, and therefore violates Hindu scriptures. They also object to the participation of divisive political figures like Modi.Yet the Indian Prime Minister is pressing ahead with inaugurating an incomplete temple—even at the price of alienating Hindu religious leaders—because of India’s May 2024 general election in which the BJP hopes to secure another national victory. If history is any guide, this tactic of harnessing majoritarian sentiment for political gain may well succeed. The Ayodhya temple’s inauguration portends dark times ahead not just for India’s Muslims but also many Hindus who remain committed to pluralism and tolerance. Hindu supremacists have long sought to reduce the broad-based Hindu religious tradition to their hateful political ideology. The Ayodhya temple is a sizeable step toward that goal.Muslims are second-class citizens in Modi’s India, regularly subjected to human rights violations. Freedom House now classifies India—once heralded as the world’s largest democracy—only “partly free” on account of the “rise in persecution affecting the Muslim population.” And there are signs that the Ayodhya temple may only mark a new era of the Hindu supremacist war on mosques. There are numerous cases in Indian courts seeking to demolish more of them in favor of building Hindu temples in Varanasi, Mathura, and other cities. Such demolitions may unleash more violence on India’s beleaguered Muslim minority, and further cement the feeling that the country is for Hindus, and Hindus alone.",

        "title_text": "The True Cost of Chinese Solar Panels",
        "body_text": "The Biden Administration’s green industrial policy was put to the test last year. Even with the support of subsidies and tariffs, U.S. solar manufacturers struggled to compete with the flood of cheap solar panels pouring out of China into the global market. While some argue that the U.S. should loosen restrictions on cheap Chinese solar panels to accelerate renewable energy deployment, this approach is unsustainable.2023 was a bumpy year in the race to deploy renewable energy. In the U.S., rising interest rates, delayed guidance for tax credit eligibility, and a project permitting process desperately in need of reform tempered deployment. However, solar emerged as a bright spot, accounting for three-fifths of new renewable electricity capacity worldwide. According to the International Energy Agency, solar is the only renewable technology being deployed at a rate to meet net zero by 2050 targets.While this trend is good news for the climate, it is better news for China. Just a decade ago, China supplied 40% of the world’s solar panels. Today, its global market share is over 80%, a near monopoly.It’s no accident that China is so well positioned to capitalize on this solar boom. In the mid-2000s, China’s government invested hundreds of billions of dollars into developing its renewables manufacturing sector, focusing on what officials have since dubbed “the new three:” electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and solar cells.Highly integrated supply chains, innovative manufacturing techniques, and consistent government support aided the growth of China’s solar industry. As did its massive domestic market—China boasts nearly four times the installed solar capacity of the U.S., which is the world’s second-largest market. However, the Chinese solar industry’s ambitions extend beyond satiating the globe’s most power-hungry economy, China. Solar exports from China increased 34% in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year.China’s solar manufacturing industry has played a crucial role in accelerating the global deployment of renewable energy. But this green patina obscures a darker truth.Read More: Rooftop Solar's Dark Side The connection between the Chinese solar industry and the Chinese Communist Party’s persecution of the Uyghur ethnic minority in Xinjiang is well-documented. Between one-third and one-half of the world’s solar-grade polysilicon is produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The U.S. has limited direct solar imports from China through policies such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and tariffs established to protect American industry from dumping and non-competitive practices. Yet, many solar modules assembled in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, the largest sources of U.S. solar panels, use Chinese components. Today, a majority of solar modules produced globally can be traced to the Uyghur Region.While Chinese solar panels may produce carbon-emissions-free energy, producing these panels is not so environmentally friendly. Coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, accounts for a majority of China's electricity generation. In Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where the most energy-intensive step in the solar panel manufacturing process, polysilicon refining, is concentrated, coal accounts for 77% of power generation. As a result, a recent study found that solar panels manufactured in China produce 30% more greenhouse gas emissions than if this supply chain was reshored to the U.S.Furthermore, China’s continued solar dominance jeopardizes the security of the U.S. and its allies. In 2021, the European Union relied on Russia for nearly half of its total natural gas consumption. The EU paid a heavy price for placing its energy security in the hands of Vladimir Putin. While some environmental advocates argue that renewable energy cannot be weaponized like fossil fuels, this is deeply naïve. Today, Europe is the destination for more than half of all Chinese solar exports. Once again, our European allies are selling their security for cheap energy. The U.S. must not make the same mistake. Though the trade dynamics of solar modules and fossil fuels differ, overwhelming reliance on any one country, particularly a hostile country, poses a real security threat.Critics of the Biden Administration’s green protectionism argue that eschewing cheap Chinese solar panels slows the energy transition. This may partly be true. Yet, while Chinese solar panels are 20% cheaper than their American equivalents, this number is not the difference between the success and failure of the U.S. solar energy industry. High interest rates and the permitting quagmire must also be addressed.Ending China’s dominant position in the global solar market is not possible. It benefits from a massive head start. However, the U.S. should work to loosen China’s chokehold. The domestic clean energy manufacturing incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are a start. The Biden Administration can also re-impose tariffs on Chinese-made solar components routed through Southeast Asian countries. Furthermore, it can pressure the European Union and other allies to take a stronger stand against Chinese solar companies’ anti-competitive behaviors and human rights violations. Finally, the Biden Administration should work with allies like India to strengthen their solar manufacturing capacity, taking advantage of lower labor costs.This strategy may slightly slow the deployment of solar energy. However, the alternative—allowing China’s global solar monopoly to continue—is simply too high of a price to pay.",

        "title_text": "Another Strong Year for Irish at 2024 BAFTAs: Your Guide to the British Academy Film Awards",
        "body_text": "Irish actors—who are decidedly not British—have once again shown up in force for the 2024 British Academy Film Awards, racking up two of the best actor nominations for Cillian Murphy’s portrayal of “the father of the atomic bomb” in Oppenheimer and Barry Keoghan’s star-turn in dark comedy Saltburn as well as one best supporting actor nomination for Paul Mescal’s role as Andrew Scott’s lover in All of Us Strangers, despite a snub for Scott who was widely expected to earn a nomination too in the best actor category.Though it’s the strongest showing this year for any nationality besides the U.S. or the U.K., it’s actually half as many nominations as the Irish got last year, when Keoghan won the best supporting actor award for his role in the tragicomedy The Banshees of Inisherin, as did his Irish co-star Kerry Condon in the best supporting actress category, while Brendan Gleeson, Colin Farrell, Daryl McCormack, and Mescal also earned acting nominations.The British Academy Film Awards—commonly known as the BAFTAs, the acronym for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, though the television awards are held separately in May—are an annual celebration of cinema, like the Oscars but British. This year will be the 77th iteration of the awards ceremony that was founded in 1949.Here’s everything to know about the 2024 BAFTAs:This year, the British Academy Film Awards ceremony is scheduled to take place on Sunday, Feb. 18, at the Royal Festival Hall in London's Southbank Centre.It will be broadcast on BBC One starting at 8 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) and will be available to stream via BBC iPlayer.Red carpet events before the awards ceremony will be streamed on the BAFTA YouTube channel.David Tennant, internationally known for holding the lead role from 2005 to 2010 and again from 2022 to 2023 in the longstanding British sci-fi show Doctor Who, is hosting the awards ceremony this year.Jane Millichip, CEO of BAFTA, said about the Scottish actor who’s also known for his theater work: “He is deservedly beloved by British and international audiences, alike. His warmth, charm and mischievous wit will make it a must-watch show next month for our guests at the Royal Festival Hall and the millions of people watching at home.”Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer appears to be the behemoth to beat, with 13 BAFTA nominations this year, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress for Emily Blunt, and Best Supporting Actor for Robert Downey Jr. The cast and crew has already received a number of top acting and overall production accolades at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards.Trailing just behind Oppenheimer is Yorgos Lanthimos’ black comedy Poor Things, which was co-produced by Irish company Element Pictures, with 11 nominations, including Best Actress for star Emma Stone and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is also competing for Best Film.Martin Scorsese’s epic Killers of the Flower Moon was nominated in nine categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Robert de Niro. Notably, Lily Gladstone, who won the Golden Globe for Best Actress and is a favorite for the Oscars, was not nominated at the BAFTAs. War film The Zone of Interest, written and directed by Jonathan Glazer, also received nine nominations.Greta Gerwig’s box-office sensation Barbie was nominated in five categories: Best Original Screenplay, Best Leading Actress for Margot Robbie, Best Supporting Actor for Ryan Gosling, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design.Among the nominees for the Rising Star Award, which is sponsored by British telecom company EE and is the only award that’s voted on by the public, are Saltburn star Jacob Elordi, Fair Play lead actress Phoebe Dynevor, How to Have Sex’s Mia McKenna-Bruce, Talk to Me’s Sophie Wilde, and Ayo Edebiri, who is known for The Bear and hails from Boston but is an Irish icon in her own way.See the full list of BAFTA nominees here.",

It May Have to Accept the New NormalMore than 7,000 women have registered for information sessions about the new program, which offers up to ¥300,000 ($2,023) toward the costs of egg-freezing, and 1,800 women have applied since October, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The government estimated demand would be far lower. It budgeted ¥60 million for subsidies, enough to award the maximum amount to 200 women.The program is open to all women between the ages of 18 and 39, a departure from earlier fertility policies that excluded unmarried women. There’s no deadline for the application and no pre-established limit to the number of subsidies that will be awarded. Tokyo Mayor Yuriko Koike told NHK the city plans to increase the budget significantly. The Japanese government is increasingly concerned by its record-low birthrate, now at 1.3. A rate of 2.1 is considered optimal to keep a population stable. In 2022, the government agreed to reimburse 70% of the costs of in-vitro fertilization (IVF).Egg freezing is one of several assisted reproductive technologies that can help extend a woman’s fertility, but it’s expensive. In Japan, costs typically run from around ¥300,000 to 600,000 but can reach into the millions.Read More: The Truth About Freezing Your EggsThe technology is also far from a panacea. Only about 8.4% of people used their frozen eggs to give birth, according to a survey of 87 clinics and hospitals conducted by the Tokyo government in August. The success rate of pregnancy using frozen eggs also drops with maternal age.Still, keeping young eggs and increasing the odds of pregnancy is a vital option for women who aren’t ready to have children, according to Noriko Taniyama, who works in the city government’s Bureau of Social Welfare, Children and Child-Rearing Support Division.Tokyo plans to assess the effects of egg freezing on birthrate by accumulating data from subsidy recipients.",

        "title_text": "In the Philippines, Onions Are Now Too Cheap",
        "body_text": "The Philippines is temporarily halting its onion imports until May—and possibly even up until July—in a bid to control prices from getting too cheap.It’s a complete 180 from the Southeast Asian nation’s problems a year ago—when dwindling supply of the staple vegetable was causing prices to become more expensive than beef. In January 2023, a mere kilogram (2.2 lbs.) of onions was priced at around 600 Philippine pesos ($10.88), or more than a day’s minimum wage.Read More: In the Philippines, Onions Are Now More Expensive Than Meat. Here’s WhySupply chain woes stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, extreme weather conditions, and other causes had pushed onion prices upwards, as did local officials’ failure to make accurate supply projections. To avoid further price surge, the Philippines increased imports.But local farmers weren’t happy about the move. “We don't simply feel the effect. It strikes right through the bones,” Onion Farmers Philippines Administrator James Ramos said in February last year, according to the Manila Times.In December 2023, the Philippines’ agriculture department permitted private firms to import as much as 21,000 tons of the vegetable, or about 123% of the country’s estimated monthly consumption. Now, however, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said in a statement on Friday that he was ordering the suspension of onion imports to prevent further depressing prices. “In principle, I agree with no onion importation until July,” Tiu Laurel said. “But that is on condition that if there is a sudden supply shortfall, we will have to import earlier.”Based on the agricultural department’s price monitoring in Manila-area markets, as of Jan. 19, local red onions have been sold for as low as 110 pesos ($1.97) per kilogram, and imported both red and white onions were priced as low as 80 pesos ($1.43)—which are about half to a third of the current retail prices of a kilogram of meat products.Farmers’ increased land allocation in the Philippines for planting onions has also pushed down local prices. According to the agriculture department, farm gate prices (the market-based price paid by retailers to producers) are now between $0.89 and $1.25. In some areas in Luzon, the Philippines’ main island, which produces about 65% of the country’s domestic onion supply, prices have dropped to as low as around $0.36. And with another expected harvest coming in February, prices could fall even more, to the disadvantage of local farmers whose livelihoods depend on steady seasonal revenue.Still, this current abundance of supply may not last, with incoming warmer temperatures and an extended dry spell due to the El Niño climate phenomenon that would allow more pests to breed and detrimentally affect onion production.The importation ban comes after the Philippine Chamber of Agriculture and Food Inc. urged the agriculture department to implement such a measure earlier this week. The group’s president, Danilo V. Fausto, told Business Mirror: “​If importation is not stopped, we will be throwing onions on the streets.”",

        "body_text": "LONDON — Indian firm Tata Steel announced Friday it will close both blast furnaces at its plant in Port Talbot, Wales, eliminating 2,800 jobs, as part of plans to make its unprofitable U.K. operation leaner and greener.Tata plans to switch from coal-fired blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces, which emit less carbon — and need fewer workers — using a half-billion pound ($634 million) investment from the British government.The company said it would “commence statutory consultation as part of its plan to transform and restructure its U.K. business.”“This plan is intended to reverse more than a decade of losses and transition from the legacy blast furnaces to a more sustainable, green steel business,” it said.The company said it expects about 2,800 jobs will be eliminated, most in the next 18 months, with a further 300 at longer-term risk.The news is a major blow to Port Talbot, a town of about 35,000 people whose economy has been built on the steel industry since the early 1900s.Unions have called for one blast furnace to remain open while the electric one is built, which would have meant fewer job cuts. They say Tata rejected their proposal.The Unite union said it would “use everything in its armory” to fight job losses, including potential strikes.At its height in the 1960s, the Port Talbot steelworks employed around 20,000 people, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. More than 300,000 people worked in Britain’s steel industry in 1971; by 2021 it was about 26,000.The steel industry now accounts for 0.1 percent of the British economy and 2.4% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to research by the House of Commons Library.Tata warned in 2022 that its U.K. operations were under threat unless it secured government funding to help it move to less carbon-intensive electric arc furnaces.Last year the U.K. government gave Tata up to 500 million pounds ($634 million) to make the Port Talbot steelworks greener.The British government said the investment would “secure a sustainable and competitive future for the U.K. steel sector.” Moving to electric furnaces would “transform the site and protect thousands of jobs, both in Port Talbot and throughout the supply chain,” it said.",
